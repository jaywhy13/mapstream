Jokar, with a best throw of 21.81m, was the gold-medal favourite ahead of Mexico's Jesus (21.06). ROLE MODEL Yesterday, Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller said Cunningham continues to be a role model. \"We are such a blessed people. Our excellence in sport extends beyond our size, but not beyond our ability and our will. Alphanso is indeed a role model for so many,\" Simpson Miller said. \"He has consistently shown that disability is not an obstacle to success. Today's (yesterday's) gold medal gives us further cause to celebrate and be proud of our great country.\" Simpson Miller, who was the minister of sport when Cunningham earned gold in the discus at the 2004 Paralympics in Athens, Greece, also commended the coach and other members of the Paralympics team. Meanwhile, other Jamaicans down to compete are Tanto Campbell, who will participate in the men's discus F54/55/56 today, and Sylvia Grant, who will be in action in the women's Javelin tomorrow.

The DPP's recommendation follows the completion of a report on the incident by the Independent Commission of Investigations (INDECOM).On Saturday, following an altercation with Kay-Ann in the Yallahs Square, the policeman reportedly shot her twice in the head, killing her on the spot.He then reportedly shot her sister, Novia, and attempted to shoot their other sister, Shemean, who said she had to run and hide behind a market vendor.An eyewitness claimed that had he not been restrained by a fellow policeman he would have probably killed all three sisters.SISTER TERRIFIEDNovia has been hospitalised with a gunshot wound to the left shoulder, while Shemean told The Gleaner: \"I am still in shock and terrified. I still can't believe what happened.\"Shemean said the sisters were protesting the policeman's treatment of Kay-Ann after she used indecent language in his presence and he attempted to arrest her but she resisted.The policeman has been in custody pending the completion of INDECOM's investigation.The DPP said in light of the high publicity of the case, a voluntary bill of indictment is to be entered to have the matter proceed directly to the Home Circuit Court. This means that no preliminary enquiry will be held at the St Thomas Resident Magistrate's Court.The DPP noted that the Michaelmas term of the Home Circuit Court opens on September 17.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7132, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0b476a3402e144c7", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:43:40.839", "title": "Lesson in self-reliance", "occurred_at": "2012-09-07T06:01:13", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120905/lead/lead4.html", "data": "Carl Gilchrist, Gleaner WriterNational hero would be proud of Marcus Garvey TechnicalIf National Hero Marcus Garvey were alive today, he probably would have been proud of the school named in his honour, in at least one aspect.Despite being branded a failing school by a former education minister, Marcus Garvey Technical High School (MGTHS) in St Ann's Bay, St Ann, can proudly boast of being a self-reliant institution, to a certain degree.Garvey, in his teachings, advocated self-reliance as the way forward for people of African ancestry.\"The school is able to sustain itself based on the size of our population and the good stewardship of resources and things like that,\" principal Leslie Riley told The Gleaner.\"For example, last year, we completed a four-classroom block using our own resources of $14.8 million, with no Government help.\"From its own resources, the school is also able to prepare its football, cricket and netball teams for inter-school competitions.The school's agricultural department also does some amount of tutorial farming, which includes the rearing of chickens, rabbits, bees and pigs, along with the cultivation of cash crops. However, praedial thieves have been rampant and the school suffers as a result. Nevertheless, the school has been managing to sell some pigs to the community and supermarkets, and chicken to the school canteen.\"So when we talk about resources, it's not that we're so desperate either. When you have a school population as big as ours (2,480 students), you really are able to amass financial resources because the canteen and the tuck shop are a captured market,\" said Riley. \"Also, there are vendors who have to pay us to use the facility, so we do sustain ourselves.\"NO SUPPORTThere is virtually no support of any kind coming from the past students' association or parent-teacher association, or even the business community.\"The business community doesn't really support us. You would have expected that the business community would want to play a vibrant role in the school, but it's not so,\" Riley disclosed.The 2011-2012 academic year ended with 2,480 students on roll and the school struggling to cope with the failing-school tag and, indeed, seeking ways to shrug it off.It would be an eventful summer.Education Minister Ronald Thwaites had publicly pledged to work with schools that have been labelled failing, in order to improve their academic outcomes.Labelled failing because of poor results in the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) examinations and indiscipline among students over the years, one of MGTHS's greatest challenges is lack of sufficient space, which has forced the adoption of the shift system.Said Riley: \"Given the population of the school, space is naturally a problem. You want them (students) to have a good education, good exposure to all the clubs and societies and extra-curricular activities, but based on the shift system, you're really not in a position to offer those extra-curricular activities as you would have liked.\"The shift system, with five-hour shifts, also meant less teacher-student contact hours.In early July, Riley told The Gleaner that the school had acquired a new building in Mansfield Heights, formerly occupied by students of Steer Town Academy.OVERCOMING SHIFT CHALLENGEThe new campus will house the school's first- and second-formers as of September, numbering around 860, which is approximately one-third of the school population. The move paves the way for the school to abandon the shift system, thus allowing more teacher-student contact hours, a recipe for increased learning.It also means that the younger students, especially the first-formers, would be insulated from ragging by the older students.So one of the main stumbling blocks, the shift system, has been removed and Riley is thankful.\"It is a welcome opportunity for us to come off the shift system, which has really, really been compromising our education programme for a sustained period,\" the principal said.The quality of students being sent to MGTHS also determines the academic performance and their output in the CSEC exams. With students with better passes in the Grade Six Achievement Test (GSAT) being placed in the traditional high-school system, schools such as MGTHS get students with the lower marks.\"We now have the challenge to build upon the deficit that they would have come here with, and that is where our major challenge is sometimes and we do not have the remedial resources to deal with them effectively,\" Riley observed.This year, the school did not receive any student from the Grade Nine Achievement Test, those students who would not have been placed by the GSAT three years earlier.Over time, given the tools, Riley expects to see an improved academic performance from the student body.rural@gleanerjm.comA section of the school.SELF-RELIANCEThe shift system has really been compromising our education for a sustained period. - Riley\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7133, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6431c87868d36c0c", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:43:44.198", "title": "Taxi drivers turn blind eye to disabled 13-y-o student", "occurred_at": "2012-09-05T03:26:29", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120905/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Rasbert Turner, Gleaner WrierSpanish Town, St Catherine:Back-to-school for 13-year-old Akeel Burton means hours in the scorching sun to get to and from school each day.The wheelchair-bound teen, who suffers from spina bifida, was seen yesterday at the gate to Eltham High School in St Catherine.\"It must be a drive that you are giving us \u0085 .We have been here for hours, can't get any vehicle.

Venesha had been hospitalised since July 17, when she and her 22-year-old sister, Nyeisha Clarke, were mowed down by a truck along Old Harbour Road in St Catherine.Clarke, a 43-year-old security officer, temporarily abandoned her job to stay by Venesha's bedside, hoping and praying for the recovery that would never come.\"My daughter passed away at 5:58 Monday morning,\" the distraught mother told The Gleaner.As for Nyeisha, who was also knocked unconscious when the driver of the truck reportedly lost control, careening onto the sidewalk after a collision with another car, she is now traumatised over the loss of her sibling.TRAUMATISED\"I have to have (Nyeisha) with me everywhere. She has not even gone back to work. She breaks down repeatedly and stays in my bed, which is strange. She has never done this before,\" Clarke said. \"It is really sad, right now. We are so sad. She died a horrible death. If she had died the same time she was hit, instead of suffering so \u0085 ,\" her voice trailed off.Nyeisha, the elder of the two who regained consciousness within a week of the accident, lamented that her younger sister had absorbed the brunt of the impact from the out-of-control truck. She regained consciousness after both were rushed to the Spanish Town Hospital, but Venesha had to be immediately transferred to the KPH.Nyeisha was on her way to an ATM while Venesha was going to the Electoral Office of Jamaica to sign documents for her national identification card when tragedy struck.\"They were hoisted and thrown metres away,\" Clarke said.FINANCIAL CHALLENGEHaving made the twice-daily trips from her home in Cromarty, St Catherine, to the KPH, Clarke told The Gleaner she felt as if the world was closing in on her. With funds in terribly short supply, she said she did not know where to turn.\"All of my money gone left me, I am in need of assistance,\" she mumbled. \"Me a look help.\"Clarke said her family was with her, standing by her side. Alas, they too have little financial reserves.\"To tell you the truth, they stand up with me, but they don't have money,\" she said.The distressed mother told The Gleaner that even before she buries Venesha, she will have to cope with a court hearing, which is scheduled for Monday of next week.Clarke told The Gleaner that both the driver and owner of the Isuzu truck, which is the property of a business establishment in St Catherine, have avoided her family since that fateful morning of July 17.For the past six weeks, Clarke existed between weeping and visiting Venesha, even as Nyeisha struggled to reclaim her life. For her, this seems almost impossible.\"After the impact, I don't remember anything at all until I regained consciousness in hospital,\" Nyeisha said.The official report states the truck, which is the property of the Bushy Park-based Bread and More Bakery, collided with a 1996 Nissan Sunny motor car and careened into the sidewalk, hitting the two young women.gary.spaulding@gleanerjm.comSeptember will mark six months since the 2012 local government elections.

This phrase aptly describes young Andr\u00e9 Haughton, PhD, lecturer in the Department of Economics at the University of the West Indies (UWI), Mona. Haughton's journey began in Mt Salem, Montego Bay, and at just 29 years old, he has already earned a doctorate in economics from the University of Essex, Colchester, in the United Kingdom. Haughton, whose main areas of specialisation are theoretical and applied economics, rose from humble beginnings, and wants persons who are growing up in situations similar to his to make their dreams come true. Despite his demanding schedule, Haughton finds the time to make motivational presentations and speeches locally and overseas.\"Things and times have changed. People are getting wiser and just need the boost to do positive things,\" Haughton said.The Cornwall College graduate said he did not grow up in luxury but lived a good life. His mother, he said, made sure he and his siblings were comfortable. \"We never went to bed hungry,\" Haughton said.Short-lived football dreamsWhile growing up, he said, he wanted to chart his career path as a professional footballer. However, guided by his mother's wisdom, Haughton said he turned to economics instead. \"I was concerned about Jamaica's economic situation and decided on a career in this area. I wanted to do economics in sixth form, but I did not get the opportu-nity. I was told I needed to have done additional mathematics,\" Haughton said.However, he was not deterred and enrolled at the UWI, Mona, where he completed a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting and economics with first-class honours. \"I knew that I was going to the UWI. Everyone in my class was going. I didn't know where the tuition was coming from and I didn't apply for a student loan,\" Haughton said.Haughton said his mother and grandmother sourced his first-year tuition and then he applied for a scholarship to complete his studies. \"My mother is always supportive of what I am doing. I couldn't put a burden on them for three years and, therefore, drafted my own plans,\" he said.Got scholarshipsHaughton received the KPMG Peat Marwick Scholarship to complete the final two years of his first degree and, while doing this, he also became involved in several co-curricular activities that he said led to other scholarships to complete his education.He completed a Master of Science degree in economics, with a scholarship from Thomas De La Rue, from the UWI in 2005, taught for two years, then went on to defend his PhD thesis, titled 'Essays on Monetary Policy in the Caribbean Region'.\"I was the youngest PhD graduate. It took me three and a half years, while some persons take up to 10. It is very rigorous and has to be done properly. I did a useful comparison between the Caribbean in relation to the United States, the United Kingdom, Asia, and other emerging markets,\" Haughton said.However, Haughton's passion lies in research and mentorship. Jamaica's economy, he said, is positioned for growth, and research that is tailor-made to suit the economies can be done so they can grow. He stated that this has not been done because of ignorance, not coming down to the level of the people and investing in the wrong things.\"Leaders over time are not in tune with the culture of the masses. The leaders are alienated from the people and do not know their culture, hence they make wrong policy decisions. The policies are complicated and miss the basics,\" Haughton said.Haughton said the Government needs to put things in place so that persons can express their personalities and maximise their potential. \"They are not trying to invest in communities, so there are so many idle people around. We are limited in terms of numbers as, with just 2.7 million people, each Jamaican is valuable to the world,\" Haughton said.Haughton has gone ahead and launched the Valley Foundation, which mentors young people in the Rose Heights area of Montego Bay. Most of them, he said, are from single-parent homes. \"We are trying to help the communities to put in the necessary infrastructure, starting with a community centre and fixing the football field in the area,\" Haughton said.Also, in his attempt to motivate especially young persons, Haughton is in the process of writing a book titled Illusion of Money, to be completed by spring of 2013. The book is a motivational guide to achieving success without placing too much emphasis on money.Persons wishing to assist with the Valley Foundation can contact Dr Haughton at: foundationvalley@gmail.com or haughton.andre@gmail.com, or follow him on twitter at @DrAndreHaughton.keisha.hill@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7138, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/959b4dc7c026b817", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:43:46.918", "title": "Buyers, beware!", "occurred_at": "2012-09-05T03:26:29", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120905/lead/lead1.html", "data": "Anastasia Cunningham, News CoordinatorAgency admits knowledge of 14-y-o murder accused's pregnancyThe attorney for a 14-year-old girl on trial for murder, who gave birth last week, has raised concerns about how the Child Development Agency (CDA) monitors criminal juveniles, after revealing that the agency misled the public when it claimed it had no knowledge of the pregnancy or involvement in the case.\"I personally wrote a letter to CDA advising them that she was pregnant after I was assigned the case last year,\" attorney-at-law Elham Bogle told The Gleaner yesterday.\"They went to her house and left a message that she was to visit them and when she went, no one (at the CDA) knew about it, and they called me and I told them that someone had come to the house from CDA. So I am at a loss now that they are saying they weren't aware. In fact, it was obvious she was pregnant at each court appearance.\"Last week, after The Gleaner revealed the girl had given birth, Dahlia Cole, CDA public relations officer, had told the newspaper that although the agency was aware of the murder case, it was never formally brought into the matter. Cole had said it was not until The Gleaner story was published that the agency became aware that the child was pregnant.But yesterday, while dismissing Bogle's claim that she had informed the CDA of the pregnancy, the agency admitted it misinformed the public when it said it was never aware the girl was expecting. The CDA now says it became aware of the pregnancy in July.SEVERE BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMSBogle, who is representing the teen in the murder case, said in addition to the CDA, the Family Court was aware and referred the child to a clinical psychologist at the Bustamante Hospital for Children for severe behavioural problems. She said the CDA had written the referral letter early this year.Bogle said she was told by the 14-year-old that the father of her child had been shot to death. But, because of other information provided by the girl, the attorney said she was not sure she knew who the baby's father really is.\"When I brought this up in court last month, the resident magistrate said that CISOCA (Centre for the Investigation of Sexual Offences and Child Abuse) may have a case against the father,\" Bogle said.The teen gave birth at the Victoria Jubilee Hospital in Kingston last Wednesday.She was living with her mother in the community of Southside in Central Kingston.When The Gleaner visited her community the day she gave birth, upset residents were in a heated discussion about the matter and called for the CDA to get involved.\"This is slackness! Dem must coulda check her out an mek sure she under control!\" one irate woman had declared.Yesterday, Bogle said the child's mother could not understand \"why she behaves like that\".ASSISTANCE SOUGHT FROM CDAThe attorney said the teen was in dire need of assistance for herself and the infant.\"The mother is not in any job, as such, and myself and the counsellor at Family Court have been giving her money, but we can only assist to a certain point. I also wrote CDA and the United Way asking for assistance,\" said Bogle.She added: \"Frankly, I don't see what role the CDA serves. I mean, in what circumstance should we call them?\"In a statement last night, the CDA said the information it provided to The Gleaner and which was published last Friday \"was not entirely correct\".\"Subsequent to the report, we received additional information from our South East Regional Office which indicated otherwise,\" Prudence Barnes, CDA's public relations manager, told The Gleaner.Barnes noted, however, that it was at the court appearance in July that it was noticed that the child was in an advanced state of pregnancy.\"The judge deemed her to be in need of care and protection because she was 14 years of age, and, therefore, under the age of consent. The judge then placed her on a supervision order, which means that the child is placed in the care of relatives, and CDA supervises and monitors. This was the first time that the child was placed directly in the care of the CDA,\" said Barnes.She said prior to that, the teen was in family care and was on a criminal charge, so she would not have been in the care of the CDA.The teen is before the court on charges of murdering 21-year-old Crissann Wilson, also known as 'Angel', on July 21 last year.Wilson, who was two months pregnant at the time, was stabbed to death following a dispute with the teen.The teen's mother was also charged with conspiracy to murder and accessory after the fact to murder, but those charges were later dropped.The case is set to continue sometime in November.anastasia.cunningham@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7139, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e738c142e2ff43b3", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:43:47.956", "title": "St Thomas cop had asked for prayer", "occurred_at": "2012-09-05T03:26:29", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120904/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Anastasia Cunningham, News CoordinatorThe religious community and police force in Yallahs, St Thomas, are in shock over what could have caused their church brethren and colleague to allegedly kill a pregnant mother of two and attempt to kill her two sisters.\"This is really, really surprising to me.

I have known him all his life. I know his father who was a policeman, who has now retired and is living abroad.\"On Saturday, following an altercation with one of three sisters in the Yallahs Square, the policeman reportedly shot 27-year-old Kay-Ann Lamont twice in the head, killing her on the spot. She was eight months pregnant.The policeman then reportedly shot her sister Novia and attempted to shoot their other sister, Shemean, who said she had to run and hide behind a market vendor.According to eyewitnesses, had he not been restrained by a fellow policeman, he would have probably killed all three women.Novia has been hospitalised with a gunshot wound to the left shoulder, while Shemean told The Gleaner: \"I am still in shock and terrified. I still can't believe what happened.\"Shemean said the women were protesting the policeman's treatment of their sister, after she used indecent language in his presence and he attempted to arrest her, but she resisted.Bennett said the policeman was himself in shock and was under a suicide watch because of his distraught mental state.\"He is very distraught and is undergoing counselling. He is really traumatised and we have to have people around him all the time,\" said the deputy superintendent, who operates from the Morant Bay Police Station.Church choir memberBennett said what was more surprising about the officer's action was that he is a Christian, a member of the choir at the Yallahs New Testament Church of God, a member of the Jamaica Constabulary Force Christian Association and a member of the St Thomas arm of the Community Safety and Security Outreach programme.The accused policeman, who has been a member of the police force for more than 12 years, was stationed at the Morant Bay Police Station and later transferred to Llandewey before moving to the Yallahs Police Station two years ago, when he was promoted to corporal.The corporal, who is reportedly in his mid 30s, lives in the Yallahs community with his wife and two children and is known by several of the residents.One church sister, who declined to be named, said on the Sunday and Wednesday before the shooting, the policeman had got up in church to testify and asked them to pray for him.\"Him say from him get promotion people a try do him something and him a beg we fi pray for him.

She found the results online.\"When I scrolled down and I saw it, I literally started to scream, shake and cry. It was one of those things like 'wow I did it',\" she said with a laugh.She chose nine subjects because she's not totally settled on a future career, but said she was leaning towards medicine.\"I can see myself going there but I'm not sure,\" said the 16-year-old. Geneille explained that the months leading up to the exams were hectic. She would come home from school, get some sleep, and then study until 4 a.m. Doing three science subjects also meant three long lab sessions per week, plus the various school-based assessments.\"Sometimes it was a real task. At times it was overwhelming. But at the same time I had my friends and I had my parents always there.

While some of these challenges are inherent, coordinated sustained efforts and strong public-private sector partnerships are required to transform the system, thus providing a level playing field for the delivery and maintenance of quality educational standards, at all levels.Besides, guided by this vision of change, Glengoffe High School in deep rural St Catherine has stepped up its drive to bring about a new genesis.In fact, as it opens its doors for the start of the 2012-2013 academic year this week, there are significant changes to its operations.\"With the decision taken not to accept any new admissions for grade seven - that's GSAT (Grade Six Achievement Test) - and also grade nine GNAT (Grade Nine Achievement Test), it's a good move in terms of getting off the shift system and creating space,\" principal George Price told The Gleaner.Moreover, the shift system will be replaced with an extended-day timetable. This means some students will attend school from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. and another set from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. However, Price indicated that this move has its accompanying challenges.\"With approximately 300 students not being accepted, it's gonna affect our finance significantly, because we are going to lose a minimum of $4 million from our school budget, which would normally come in as tuition, auxiliary fees and PTA (parent-teachers association) contribution,\" he explained.Notwithstanding, Roosevelt Lawrence, president, Glengoffe Community Development Committee (CDC) hailed the repositioning of the school as a step in the right direction.\"It's an excellent move because the students were always at a disadvantage, not only in terms of less time at school but leaving home early and going home late, especially in the country area,\" he said.'Failing' schoolOnly last year, the 43-year-old institution came under the microscope when former Prime Minister and Education Minister Andrew Holness named it as one of four 'failing' schools in the island. The others are Marcus Garvey Technical High School, St Ann; Holy Trinity in Kingston; and Balaclava High in St Elizabeth. He cited deterioration in discipline, poor academic performances and complaints of poor management and indicated that intervention was required.However, Price, who was on study leave at the time, said the classification was unfounded as in addition to being ill-equipped, the institution, which was upgraded in 2000, has never been the beneficiary of top GSAT performers.\"It's a shame to say the students' entry levels are atrocious and in most cases a significant number of them are below the passing grade, not in just one subject but in all five areas that they were tested,\" he noted.Even so, he said the teachers' hard work and willingness to maximise the limited resources to tap into students' potential were often reflected in several notable performances.\"Denventon Lewis, who obtained seven CSEC passes this year, is one example. He was placed here with scores of 23 per cent for mathematics, 29 for science, 28 for social studies, 21 for language arts and six for communication task and he got seven subjects. The teachers here must be doing something right,\" he argued.Furthermore, as vice-principal Heather Grizzle pointed out to The Gleaner, in previous years, their plea for additional classrooms, furniture, upgraded equipment and a generator went unanswered.\"I asked some companies to sponsor equipment for the workshops, but we are so rural, we are out of where the industries are so they ignored us. We need machines for metal work, woodwork, the home economics department needs a freezer and a washing machine. We also need a generating plant because electricity goes off regularly in this area,\" she detailed.However, Price expressed optimism and indicated that there was light at the end of the tunnel.\"The ministry has pledged to give us some tents for three temporary classrooms, in addition to three prototype buildings so that the students will have more space,\" he said.Likewise, in keeping pace with the institution's vision for change, corporate giant RJR Communications Group has stepped up and has transformed an existing building into a health-and-wellness centre which was officially opened last Thursday.But that's not the only additional feature for the new school year, after two years in the making, the school now boasts a state-of-the-art library. This facility is expected to boost its technological capabilities which were initiated with the establishment of two e-learning labs. But Grizzle is appealing for more learning material and manpower to staff the labs.'If we could get some software for reading, we have computers, we need age-appropriate material because some of these senior students have difficulty reading and the ego comes in, so you have to get appropriate material to motivate them to read,\" she explained.Excel in sportsThough there is no playing field, the St Catherine-based school has managed to excel in sports, producing outstanding athletes such as middle-distance runner Andr\u00e9 Drummond. It is for this reason that Price has lauded PUMA for providing gear for the athletes over the years. However, Grizzle yearns for more sponsorship in this regard.\"One of my dreams is to have transportation for the athletes that costs us every year. We have to hire bus to and from training grounds and to and from the locations of the meet and that is costly, so if we could get a large school bus and maybe, a pickup too, because sometimes we have to go for equipment,\" she added.And during the summer holidays, most of the classrooms were fitted with new doors and damaged desks repaired.On the other hand, while the parent- teachers' association has been weak, the past students' association, which has undertaken several initiatives including the tiling of the students' bathroom, has pledged to step up support for its alma mater.\"Our support is vital because the past students are the life of the school,\" said Carol Rutherford, president of the past students' association.At the same time, Lawrence reiterated the value of partnership for transformation and said that although the CDC is strapped for cash it would continue to lend its support where possible.\"We installed a kitchenette in the staff room and helped with the beautification of the school, but while we are willing to help, we don't have the financial resources to help in the manner in which we want to,\" Lawrence noted.As Glengoffe High continues to effect change and make an invaluable contribution to the educational development of the community, hope remains high they will be able to attract additional sponsors to continue their mission.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7143, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1f7727aa2516e9cf", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:43:50.171", "title": "A mother's grief", "occurred_at": "2012-09-05T03:26:29", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120904/lead/lead6.html", "data": "Anastasia Cunningham, News Coordinator\"Me feel like me a guh dead!

They were awaiting a robot taxi to head home to Logwood.\"Kay-Ann a cuss a tell her cousin how dem rob har downtown and say 'b...c...',\" she said.McCloud said the police officer, who was on patrol with a group of others, overheard and told 27-year-old Kay-Ann that she could be arrested for using indecent language.

She resisted and her sisters protested. In the attempt to take her to the station, eight months pregnant Kay-Ann and the officer reportedly fell in the road.Eyewitnesses said they began to laugh, which later turned to screams as the officer just \"get vex and jump up\", brandished his firearm and shot the pregnant mother of two twice in the head while she was still on the ground. He then reportedly turned his gun on Novia, who attempted to run, hitting her in the left shoulder.Witnesses said he then turned the gun on Shemean, who ran and hid behind a market vendor.\"The woman hold up har hand and sey me not involve officer,\" Williams said. \"Believe me, if one a di other officer neva grab him from behind and hold on pon him, him woulda kill di three a dem.

Heavily armed police officers were deployed to keep the irate protesters in check, who rained a barrage of angry words, laced with expletives, on the officers.The protesters called for justice, some demanding that they hand over the accused officer to them to deliver their own justice.\"A di second time now police kill a pregnant woman in Yallahs!\" one shouted.\"This is spiteful and wicked, wicked, wicked!\"Deputy Superintendent Patrick Bennett, in charge of operations for St Thomas, tried to appease their anger.\"The community is hurting really badly and it is no different with members of the force who he works with, plus we ourselves are members of the community,\" Bennett shared with The Gleaner.\"We are willing to do whatever it takes to come to a resolution. We know that it is going to be difficult so we have to work with the community, visit with them, speak with them, pray with them. We have to do just about everything to ensure that moving on from here, we not only get the community and the police closer together, but we can reach a situation where this type of incident does not happen again.\"Following a closed-door meeting at the Yallahs Police Station, McCloud said nothing could ease the pain of what happened to her daughters, but she was consoled by the comforting words of some of the officers, who faithfully promised that justice would be served.\"Kay-Ann is so nice and humble and very jovial. Everybody always talk 'bout her. Dem call her Bollo. Nothing nuh trouble Kay-Ann. A just because she get rob why she cuss di bad word.

According to researchers at the British Medical Research Council, sperm counts all around the world have decreased by 50 per cent in the last 50 years.In addition, disorders of the male reproductive organs, including cancer of the testicles, undescended testicles, small and abnormal penises, have more than doubled. Testicular cancer has become the most common malignancy in young males.Other problems with other reproductive organs: the prostate gland in men and the uterus in women (75 per cent of Jamaican women have fibroids) have skyrocketed. All these reproductive organs have one thing in common: they are extremely sensitive to hormonal disturbance.Hormonal disruptersThe sad reality is that we now live in an environment polluted with unhealthy chemicals, particularly substances that behave like the female hormone oestrogen. Researchers believe that many of the above disorders are caused by exposure of the unborn foetus to those oestrogenic environmental chemicals. Other studies done on pregnant women who were exposed to oestrogen drugs revealed a similar occurrence of such abnormalities and decrease in sperm levels in their male offspring. This may even be a factor in the increasing levels of homosexuality in young men as well as precocious puberty, early sexual development, and teenage pregnancy in our girls.Today, women are exposed to these external oestrogen from a wide array of sources: drugs, food, water, air, even some skin and hair-care products. They consequently pass them on to their developing sons and daughters, with the result being an increase in male infertility and genital abnormality in boys and sexual and gynaecological disorders in girls. Many non-oestrogenic chemicals also contribute to the problem, including some pesticides, plasticisers, food colourings, solvents, metals, dioxins, and alcohol. Environmental contamination has resulted in human exposure to oestrogenic chemicals such as dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane that are resistant to biodegradation and persist in the food chain, and accumulate in human and animal tissues for a very long time.Changes in diet and lifestyle also play a role. Increases in body fat are known to increase the body's own production of oestrogen in both men and women. As men age, their fat cells manufacture more and more female hormones by converting their male hormone testosterone into the female hormone oestrogen. Research indicates that the average 50-year-old man has higher levels of female hormones that the average 50-year-old woman. The fatter the man, the greater this hormonal reversal. These hormonal shifts carry far-reaching physical, psychological and social consequences.Correcting the imbalanceAs a part of your general medical check-up, ask your health-care provider to do a detailed hormonal profile. This will provide useful information on your various hormone levels, including your sex hormones. Unfortunately, it will not indicate the levels of other abnormal hormone-like chemicals in your body.Lifestyle changesThe appropriate diet with a heavy emphasis on fresh fruit and vegetables. Minimise your consumption of processed, chemical-laced foods. Try to 'eat organic' as much as possible. Specific foods are known to assist in hormonal regulation. These include soy, green tea, Omega 3-fatty acids, high-fibre foods and the crustiferous vegetables. I employ a very effective nutritional supplement programme called Cellular Nutrition to assist with hormonal balance. Specific herbs like ginseng, tang kuei, and evening primrose oil may also help the body to naturally regulate its hormonal balance.Daily exercise, stress management and regular sun exposure also assist with hormonal balance.It is important to assist the body to prevent and remove toxic chemicals from accumulating in the body. A high-fibre diet and a high consumption of clean water is valuable. Colon cleansing, sauna baths, sweating, and other detox techniques done regularly are also very useful.Specific vitamins and herbs like the antioxidants, aloe vera, milk thistle and probiotics can be used.More aggressive detox strategies, including intravenous chelation therapy, may also be employed.Hormone replacement therapyHormonal balance can be restored with the appropriate and safe use of hormone replacement therapy, but specific guidelines must be followed.First, the appropriate tests of hormone status must be done by your doctor. Then the necessary hormone can be replaced using bio-identical hormones. That means giving the body the exact substance that it makes, not a synthetic, unnatural chemical. Testosterone, oestrogen. progesterone, thyroid hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone and cortisol, are all available in bio-identical forms. Your doctor would decide on the appropriate dosage and method of administration. Finally, you must be followed up and your hormone levels monitored to achieve optimal results.

He is in an associate degree programme at a small college.A. You need to get him into counselling right away. Gambling is a bad habit. You need to get him help now, so he can stop.Q. My 12-year-old son keeps correcting my seven-year-old when she makes a grammatical error. It was cute at first, but now it is getting to be annoying. How can I get him to stop?A.Tell your son that he can help his sister when she makes a mistake, but he must correct her in a nice way. You can model the way in which he should do this, so that he can know what you want him to do.Q. I am ready for my first parent teacher association (PTA) meeting with a vengeance. I am tired of the fund-raising aspect of the school. How can we as parents be guided to help our children and not forever be planning a barbecue. Can I say this to the principal?A. If you need to get help with parenting or academic challenges that your child may have that you think will benefit the PTA body, you should share this with the principal. I am sure the principal would be happy to hear this and plan to see how the school will be able to help you. Fund-raising will always be a part of a school's programme, as money is always needed to strengthen or start programmes. Orlean Brown-Earle, PhD, is a child psychologist and family therapist.

I am 30 years old and all my life I have been waiting for 'Mr Right' without success. Those persons who like me, I do not like, and those I fell in love with did not give me the time of day. It has been frustrating because I want to get married and...A. I am happy that you have found your Mr Right. Perhaps your boyfriend wants a quick marriage because he is dating the relationship from the time he was your secret admirer some five years ago. However, you are perceiving the relationship as having started just a month ago. If you feel you need time to process this new, loving relationship, then it is your right to explain to him why you want time. It is a big step to move from friendship to marriage, but it is good to have a foundation of friendship on which to build. It does not necessarily mean that two good friends will make good marriage partners, but to have a meaningful and successful marriage one has to be good friends first. You have many things going for the relationship. You are communicating well, you belong to the same congregation, and he has qualities which you admire in spite of the lack of the physical qualities you originally desired. When you are considering the proposal, please ask what it says about him that it took him five years and a few broken relationships to muster the courage to tell you that he is in love with you. Also, is he rushing into marriage because he is unhappy at home, or is he responding to family or peer pressure to get married? Additionally, you might want to know more about the in-laws and how the two families might relate. It might be helpful to talk with your pastor about the marriage proposal and you giving it active consideration. Furthermore, you and your boyfriend might want to explore with your pastor or marriage counsellor such issues as managing your finances, sexuality and sexual intimacy, how to keep the marriage alive and exciting, etc. It seems that if possible, you should meet his parents and he should meet your parents and he should tell them of his intentions.If he is as in love with you as he says, he will wait on the answer while you sort out certain issues.editor@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7585, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0fe788908db373d5", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:44.489", "title": "Convicted corrupt cop's appeal dismissed", "occurred_at": "2012-10-05T02:15:11", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121005/lead/lead92.html", "data": "THE COURT of Appeal has dismissed the appeal of police constable Everton Goulbourne who attempted to solicit $50,000 from a motorist in 2007.Goulbourne and constable Elorda Smith were convicted last year by Resident Magistrate Sheron Barnes for breaching the Corruption Prevention Act.Goulbourne was fined $250,000 or six months imprisonment while Smith was fined $200,000 or six months imprisonment.$50,000 to avoid chargesThe complainant had testified at the trial in the Savanna-la-Mar Resident Magistrate's Court in Westmoreland that after his minibus was seized, the policemen told him to pay $50,000 to avoid 10 charges being laid against him.The policemen appealed their convictions.

They include enlisting the assistance of local and international partners; appointing competent and resourceful persons to work with the Child Development Agency (CDA) and the various children's boards; making submissions to Cabinet on the use of the resources; lobbying for additional funding for children's homes; ensuring government funding for social workers at the Centre for the Investigation of Sexual Offences and Child Abuse (CISOCA); and working with other agencies and ministries to arrange proper accommodation for children in custody.The group was also charged with reviewing the recommendations of the 2010 'Report of the Task Force on the New Regime for Juveniles in Remand and Correctional Facilities in Jamaica'.Over the past two weeks new concerns have been raised over how the state monitors and manages children in conflict with the law, following an article published in the Gleaner about a 14-year-old girl who got pregnant and gave birth while on trial for murder.Several conflicting reports subsequently emerged as to the state's involvement with the teen and the CDA was called on to provide answers. Among those demanding answers were the attorney for the teen, Elham Bogle, Jamaicans For Justice and Help JA Children.Urgent areaDuring the meeting, Hanna noted that another urgent area being dealt with by the group was ensuring clarity where existing legislation is perceived to have created areas of overlap or possible gaps in relation to the responsibility, role and power of State agencies, such as the CDA and the Department of Correctional Services, in suitably accommodating all children when they come in conflict with the law.In addition to Hanna, the working group includes Minister of Justice Senator Mark Golding; permanent secretary in the Ministry of Youth and Culture, Robert Martin; Commissioner of Corrections Lieutenant Colonel Sean Prendergast; Deputy Commissioner of Police Jevene Bent; Chief Executive Officer of the CDA, Carla Francis-Edie; CDA Board Chairman Maxine Henry-Wilson; Acting Children's Advocate Justice Henderson Downer; and representatives of the Office of the Children's Registry, the Attorney General's Chambers, as well as the Ministries of Justice, National Security, Finance and Planning, Education and Health.The working group will meet weekly at the Ministry of Youth and Culture in order to complete its work in the shortest possible timeframe.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7154, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/71b6d1dfd246a73e", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:43:56.121", "title": "Ferguson lauds effort to promote wellness in schools", "occurred_at": "2012-09-03T04:27:15", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120903/lead/lead95.html", "data": "Minister of Health Dr Fenton Ferguson has commended the focus on promoting healthy lifestyles in schools in observing Caribbean Wellness Day to be observed on Saturday, September 8.The minister said Jamaica has joined with the rest of the countries of the Caribbean Community in remaining committed to the fight against non-communicable diseases as stated in 2007, as part of the Port-of-Spain Declaration, which saw countries in the region \"uniting to stop the epidemic of chronic non-communicable diseases\".\"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a major concern for Jamaica. 2009 figures show that NCDs accounted for approximately 60 per cent of death among men and 75 per cent of deaths among women, more than what was recorded as a result of motor vehicle accidents,\" said Minister Ferguson.He further stressed that these diseases are no longer age-specific and also affect children and adolescents.

To tell you the truth, I was not for it. The instructions given are not being adhered to so come Monday morning the police, along with motor vehicle examiners, will again embark on the no-tinting issue,\" Lewis said.\"I am sorry about that but it is something that I can't help because, what has happened, they were given an inch and they have now taken a mile, so it is full time now to have this matter dealt with in a decisive   manner once and for all.\" Last year, the police went on a drive to clamp down on buses and taxis with dark tints following outcry that children were engaging in lewd behaviour while travelling in these vehicles. Authorities were later forced to cease the clampdown operations following accusations of double standards after operators of public passenger vehicles pointed to the government-run Jamaica Urban Transit Company buses that have been allowed to operate with tints. The authorities later moved to revise the tint grade allowing for low-grade tints on public passenger vehicles.

So, yes, it's not viable, because what is happening now is not long-term in my opinion,\" said Diana McCaulay of the Jamaica Environment Trust.\"Paying for the plastic so people have an incentive to bring in the plastic is potentially a viable thing. But my understanding that the margins on the plastic bottles, that is, the difference between what it costs to collect and store, ship them and then sell them, is not enough to pay people,\" added McCaulay.According to her, there are only a few ways in which recycling business can be funded, and in some countries it is done via deposit legislation.\"That is a law that says, if you have a plastic bottle you have to charge a deposit on it. Essentially the person selling has to take back the bottle. Once you do that, there is an economic incentive,\" she stated.Just not viableOne major player in the local plastic bottle recycling market is now undecided about continuing as he argues that it is just not viable.The operator, who asked that his name be withheld, said persons in the business of collecting plastic bottles and shipping them overseas for recycling are not breaking even.\"People want money for plastic. We can't afford to pay, because there is currently no demand for the product. The price is going down on the world market,\" the operator said.McCaulay agreed and argued that for the industry to become viable it must become capital and machine intensive.In Jamaica there is currently no deposit legislation as traders in plastic have strongly resisted lobby for such legislation, McCaulay said while adding that direct taxation will assist small operators with less resources.Also called a packaging tax in some countries, the tax is applied in Jamaica, but the recycling programme it was supposed to support, has not been implemented.\"The programme was never implemented, but the tax is being collected,\" she stated.The Environmental Levy passed in 2007, but was repealed in May on imports from CARICOM.However some Jamaican manufacturers say it will put the industry at a disadvantage compared to Trinidad and Tobago.The 0.5 per cent levy is charged on all imports and goes to the coffers of the central treasury.

Audit finds serious mismanagement of money at Caymanas Track LimitedGary Spaulding, Senior Gleaner WriterDismal fiscal management of the operations of Caymanas Track Limited (CTL) between 2008 and 2011 is being blamed for the abysmal financial condition in which the entity now finds itself.A forensic audit on the operations of CTL has found that approximately $259 million held in short-term deposits was completely wiped out from 2008 to 2011, catapulting the company into a perilous financial bind.This is among a slew of findings unearthed by Public Accountability Inspectorate (PAI) Division of the Ministry of Finance and Planning which probed CTL's operations.The Sunday Gleaner obtained a copy of the report that highlighted concerns with \"poor management\" of the funds under the previous regime.\"There is cause for concern in regards to the utilisation of the funds on Short Term Deposit and the rapid decrease of the funds in the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 financial years,\" the report stated.The audit found that short-term deposits dwindled from $258.9 million in 2008 to zero in December 2011.\"A 101 per cent increase in the entity's losses in the 2010/2011 financial year over the previous period signified that severe mismanagement of the entity's resources has been undertaken as well as a serious over-budgeting of revenue and or under-budgeting of expenses,\" the report asserted.Horace Dalley, the minister with responsibility for CTL declined to make a definitive statement on that matter.\"We at the Ministry of Finance and Planning commissioned a forensic audit of CTL and the Customs Department in January 2011,\" he said.\"I am aware that the CTL audit is completed but I have not yet seen the findings.\"Dalley said it would take him a few days to review the report after which he would brief Cabinet, before making a statement on the findings to Parliament.Loss of fundsThe audit found that there was a loss of funds between 2008 and 2011 suggesting that this affected the income earnings projected in CTL's short-term deposit.It further notes that investment income also decreased and CTL's liquidity was impaired while deficit deepened.\"The PAI found no evidence that a reserve was operated by CTL,\" the report stated.The PAI stated that a notion of a cash reserve may have emerged when a former officer of CTL told a Board meeting on April 17, 2009 that $25 million was taken out of the \"cash reserve\" to make retroactive payments to staff.The PAI highlighted the possibility that the notion of a reserve fund being held by CTL may have been due to misinformation presented to members of staff prior to a strike about the existence of the now depleted short-term deposits.The probe found that CTL failed to adequately manage its receivables from trade in the 2010/2011 financial year as approximately 68 per cent of the increase in receivables in 2011/2011 over the 2009/2010 financial year resulted from trade receivable.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7167, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b219a5d06341a259", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:04.343", "title": "No guarantee with fake results -

This enables the department to provide transcripts for examinations sat with several examining bodies ... ,\" the website said.The OEC is also responsible for dispatching results to schools and private candidates.Several educational institutions and companies in Jamaica accept the preliminary results slips as proof that an applicant has achieved the required subjects until they get the certificate.But many employers and educational institutions do not follow through on the verification process.A human resources manager at a major quasi-state agency told The Sunday Gleaner that while persons are employed based on the results shown on the preliminary slip they are not offered full employment until the official certificates are produced.However, a major private-sector entity reported that while it requests the official certificate, a number of its staff members are now employed based only on the preliminary results slip.tyrone.reid@gleanerjm.com \n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7168, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c799cf0e28cee701", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:05.218", "title": "CXCs for $ale - Schools, employers and other institutions could be taking in people with purchased results", "occurred_at": "2012-09-03T04:27:15", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120902/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Tyrone Reid, Senior Staff ReporterCaribbean ExaminationS Council (CXC) passes are available for sale on the streets of Kingston for up to $12,000 per subject, even if you did not take the exam.\u00a0 The Sunday Gleaner has been able to purchase a solid pass in mathematics from a scammer who provided us with a preliminary result slip which is an almost perfect copy of the ones distributed by CXC.During a covert operation last week, a member of our news team, posing as a desperate student, bought a grade one in the CXC's Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) mathematics from one of the scammers.After making the link via the BlackBerry messenger service, our reporter met with the man in downtown Kingston and handed over the $12,000.The preliminary result slip was delivered days later with the fake name and the fake date of birth which our reporter had given to the scammer.The scammers had added a registration number, centre number and 'Jamaica Private' signifying that the exam was taken privately in January 2012.The preliminary slip shows an A (for knowledge), A (for comprehension) and B (for reasoning) profile, which is just shy of a distinction.The preliminary results slip had the watermarks of the CXC that appear on the authentic versions of the document.Not even officials at CXC's local office in \nJamaica could immediately tell the difference between the purchased slip\n and an authentic preliminary results slip which was printed in \nBarbados.It took a check of the CXC database where it\n was found that the name and grade had not been officially entered to \ndetermine that the result slip was fake.CXC \ndatabaseThe scammer had claimed that in addition to \nthe preliminary slip, the information would have been added to the CXC \ndatabase by one of his sources who worked with the regional \nentity.\"For the CXC (CSEC), each subject costs \n$12,000. You get the CXC slip and it says 'Jamaica Private'' like you \nsit the CXC exam privately,\" he said.\"You don't get a\n certificate because you don't need one. You just give them the slip if \nyou applying for a job or going college.

That's all. You get\n it in two to three days.\"When asked if he was sure \nthe grade would illegally find its way on  to the CXC database, the \nscammer told our news team that his illegal operation has been thriving \nfor years.\"I'm doing this for years now darling. I \njust drop off two at wharf this morning. It's in demand. I'm sure when I\n deliver yours you're gonna tell a friend about it too,\" he \nbragged.However, officials at CXC's Jamaica office \ndenied that the scammers have the capacity to breach its fortified \ndatabase and input the cooked-up grades into its \nsystem.According to Susan Giles, senior assistant \nregistrar at the western zone office of the CXC located in Jamaica, the \ndatabase used by regional body to store grades cannot be cracked by the \nscammers.\"They can't get into our database. No doubt \nabout that. Our system is too protected,\" said \nGiles.She said her office was not aware that scammers\n had obtained the preliminary results slip template and were illegally \nprofiting from fraudulent grades.\"I didn't know it \nwas happening.

I understand that a paint job was done courtesy of an allocation from the Tourism Enhancement Fund (TEF),\" said Diane Sommerville, manager of the facility.\"The funding turned out to be less than what was announced and the bath, which was damaged during Hurricane Dean, was refurbished.\"Other than the paint job, the place looks the same way it has looked since 2008,\" Sommerville told The Sunday Gleaner.No fiscal space Last week, Bartlett also admitted that the planned refurbishment was reduced to a bare minimum because \"the fiscal space was not available\".\"The plan was for more than $100M to do refurbishing of Milk River and Bath (St Thomas). Then what happened to us, with all the nice plans that we had for projects, fiscal consolidation came and suddenly all the money just disappeared,\" said Bartlett.\"All the money just went into the central treasury management, so nothing could be done. Then, the Government decided that it would divest this (Milk River Hotel and Spa) and some other such facilities and attractions,\" stated the former tourism minister.Bartlett said in the case of Milk River \"all we ended having to do is some basic little fix up\".But even that paint job is now faded and is crying out for a fresh coat.Unattractive old furniture is everywhere, except the lobby, which was given a facelift. The administrative offices are the same as they were in 1794.\"Up to when we left office, both of them, (Milk River Spa and Bath Fountain in St Thomas) were slated for divestment. I don't know what this new Government will do. I don't think that those things can change, however, as the objective conditions that gave rise to the decision to divest is worse now than it was before,\" said Bartlett.Tourism Minister Dr Wykeham McNeill agreed that the facility is in need of upgrading, even as he argued that both administrations have made attempts to divest it.\"St Thomas Bath and Milk River Hotel and Spa are wellness facilities, which have not kept up with the times. We want to position them for a certain market, but it has to have significant infrastructural development and investment. So I have asked the board to present me with a plan,\" said McNeill.\"We are looking at joint venture, divestment, lease or public-private partnership as options to make it attractive to the market so that it best accomplishes the goal of catering to the needs of Jamaicans here and in the diaspora, and visitors from all over the world,\" added McNeill.He said he would love if Baden-Baden, the international and exclusive thermal-spa resort, located at the foothills of the Black Forest in the south-western part of Germany, would add its label to the Clarendon-based facility.\"There is a market for the services of Milk River, but I believe that the market will be significantly greater if we get it to world-class standards.\"Hope expressedLast week, the management of the facility, which is nestled at the foot of Carpenter's Mountain on the south-western tip of Clarendon, expressed hope that a long-prepared redevelopment plan will be implemented.\"A business plan is in place. We just need to pull it from the file 13, dust it off and jump on it,\" suggested Sommerville.She said any redevelopment must take in the building called 'The Ark', which was damaged and has not been used since Hurricane Dean which affected the island in 2007.When The Sunday Gleaner visited the Milk River Hotel and Spa last Tuesday, it was two days after the rains associated with Tropical Storm Isaac lashed sections of the island.Watermarks in the courtyard of the facility indicated that the spa had come under water, but this was less than when Hurricane Dean passed by.At that time, visitors to the facility were trapped as the Milk River overflowed its bank.\"It happens all the time there is heavy rains. The river overflows its banks and floods the roadways and settles in the driveway. Within 24 hours it is usually gone. So river training is the problem, but river training should not hold back refurbishment,\" argued Sommerville.She pointed to one good sign, the significant road improvement which has taken place in the area in recent time.Bad roads have often inhibited persons seeking a soak in the healing stream, but this time around, the drive to the facility was relatively smooth.Photos by Ian Allen /Photographer\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7170, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d38b5644b537dbde", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:07.151", "title": "Holy Trinity ...

Of that number we called in about 180 who had an average GSAT (Grade Six Achievement Test) mark of 40 per cent and lower.\"We administered a test and the results told us we had work to do ... a lot of work. About 78 were reading below the grade-three level!\" said Bennett.\"Again this year, the intake was about 350 for GSAT and we took in another 50 from GNAT (Grade Nine Achievement Test). We looked at the GSAT scores and about 120 of the students placed at this school scored 40 per cent and below.\"Eighty-one of this number turned up for testing and already (we have found that) 32 of them are reading at grade-two level and below,\" added Bennett.\"We will have to capture the rest when they come in for September, but it's not looking good,\" was the frank admission when The Sunday Gleaner spoke with Bennett in August.The scenario seems to beg for remediation, but Bennett is not entirely enthusiastic about that route alone.\"Remediation is expensive, inefficient and uncertain,\" he argued while giving his approval to identifying and focusing on the students with potential.\"We have to come up with strategies and innovations to take account of the student profile,\" Bennett said.\"So there is remediation and then we try to identify those students with good potential and channel our efforts,\" said Bennett.We need better parental support The task of the teachers at Holy Trinity High is made more difficult by the lack of parental involvement.As it is, many of the parents seem indifferent to the lack of progress of their children in the school.\"We sent out letters to all of the parents for the below-par students we tested and do you know how many turned up? One!\" principal Sadpha Bennett lamented.\"What we find is that those students who do well often have good parental support.\"But even in the cases where the parents are involved, Bennett is convinced that there is a structural problem affecting the performance of his students.\"The shift system must go!\" he said with the slightest hint of a rant.\"We have two shifts, 7 a.m. to 12 noon and 12 noon to 5  p.m. We squeeze in 40 periods per week, that's 20 hours. Take out 21/2 hours per week for break and 21/2 hours for form time. That leaves us with 15 hours contact time. What kind of teaching can take place?\" he asked.To surmount that challenge, Holy Trinity has put in a third shift that is called an extended day. This runs from 7 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and caters to the grade-11 and some grade-10 students who are pursuing CSEC or vocational subjects.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7171, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/da3144aa1d664747", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:07.622", "title": "Asbestos scare at Holy Trinity", "occurred_at": "2012-09-02T03:18:41", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120902/lead/lead5.html", "data": "More than one year after asbestos frames were discovered at the Holy Trinity High School the education ministry is yet to complete the removal and replacement of them.A lack of financial resources has been blamed for the slow pace of the work and the new school year will begin tomorrow with gaping holes where the frames once stood.But the hard-working administrators at the school are not the ones to be blamed for the delay.\"One day a senior teacher came to me to point out that one of the many ventilation louvres was broken,\" Principal Sadpha Bennett told The Sunday Gleaner.\"We began to discuss how we were going to replace it when the teacher remarked, 'but this is not wood like we think it is' and I said that it is not concrete either since it was so thin ... then the realisation hit us ... asbestos,\" added Bennett.That was June 2011.The presence of asbestos in any environment, let alone a school, is no joke. Persistent exposure to asbestos fibres can cause asbestosis, a condition where an accumulation of the fibres leads to scarring of lung tissue and shortness of breath, or mesothelioma - a rare form of cancer.Removal and disposalSeveral local institutions ranging from the National Water Commission to the Fire Service have had to deal with their own asbestos crises in recent years.Following the discovery Bennett immediately got busy.\"I contacted Professor Ishankumba Kawa at the UWI (University of the West Indies). I knew of his work from my studies up there.

It took one year to get an answer,\" Bennett said.\"The ministry officers told me in July 2012 to remove the louvres with immediate effect,\" the principal recounted.\"The truth is that we just did not have the funds,\" said Cheryl Bromfield, director of communications at the education ministry in response to Sunday Gleaner queries.Building officer Uel Gordon was the education ministry's point man in coordinating the response to the asbestos problem.The money to do the repairs was later identified out of Holy Trinity's subvention.\"Once the funds were identified our director of technical services, Carey Brown, gave the go-ahead and Mr Gordon followed through immediately,\" argued Bromfield.This summer, the administrators at Holy Trinity painted the perimeter walls and freshened up the classrooms but the gaping holes where asbestos louvres once were are still there, and there is no word as yet on when the replacements will be put in.But Bennett expects new louvres before the end of September 2012.\"We're still in discussions about the modalities for replacement, funds and so on, but we expect that to be resolved soon.\"\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7172, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7f2a7d4512f124c6", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:08.069", "title": "School enjoys sweet success", "occurred_at": "2012-09-02T03:18:41", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120902/lead/lead6.html", "data": "Attending a school labelled as failing by a former prime minister is one thing.

Can you imagine how much I will be required to pay back per month,\" said Constantine Douglas, a disgruntled homeowner.He has lived in Seaview Gardens for the last 29 years and is upset that although the scheme was Government constructed the National Housing Trust (NHT) will not offer home-improvement loans unless the owners have their titles.Financial institutionsThat position is similar with other financial institutions, as the titles for the houses are held as security until the loans or mortgages are fully discharged.With selling or major improvement not an option, residents have instead found themselves \"in a straitjacket\" as they are unable to \"seven or eleven,\" Douglas declared recently.The residents charge that the problem is seemingly insurmountable, as six ministers of housing have been installed since the construction of the scheme, which started under the Michael Manley administration of the 1970s.The scheme was born when the late Anthony Spaulding was the minister of housing and continued under ministers O.D. Ramtallie, Bruce Golding, Easton Douglas, Robert Pickersgill and Horace Chang.The housing portfolio is now in the hands of Dr Omar Davies with the minister without portfolio in the ministry Dr Morais Guy, having day-to-day responsibility.The Sunday Gleaner has learnt that the lands were acquired by the Government using the compulsory Land Acquisition Act but recent efforts to locate the original owners have been unsuccessful.For Rohan Riley, sorting out the titles issue cannot be done soon enough.\"I have been living there for 25 years, and finished paying my mortgage from 2010. I would really like to do some improvement to the house but I can't do anything without the title,\" Riley told The Sunday Gleaner.Last week, Guy told our news team that if the Government was the owner of the land the titles should be available.\"I cannot see what legal impediment that would prevent the homeowners from getting their titles,\" said Guy.\"Unless there is something that we don't know. But I will see what I can find out relating to this specific matter,\" Guy added.According to Guy, the Government is in possession of nearly 9,000 titles for homeowners dating back to the 1960s and 70s where small sums are outstanding to complete the payments.He said the ministry has proposed that the titles be handed over to the owners with the understanding that the properties will be developed.Attorney-at-law Wentworth Charles agreed with Guy that there should not be an issue if the Government owns the land.\"Unless there is some objection from the person or persons from whom it was compulsory acquired or other issues that have not been resolved, such as a caveat been placed on the title, the homeowners should get their titles,\" said Charles.\"Just since week I dealt with an individual with titling issues from the Seaview community. I spoke to someone at the ministry of housing in their legal department, but I can't recall what was the explanation,\" Charles told The Sunday Gleaner.\"It could not be something in law, because under the Act you can acquire property. If you (homeowner) had a mortgage, it means that there was a title on which a mortgage was registered.\"Or maybe what was done, was that the owners were issued with a title paper saying this lot was allotted to you at a cost of x amount for x number of years,\" Charles surmised.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7174, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5f6ee4454904536b", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:08.949", "title": "Drug firm says sorry 50 years late", "occurred_at": "2012-09-02T03:18:41", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120902/lead/lead8.html", "data": "BERLIN (AP): The German manufacturer of a notorious drug that caused thousands of babies to be born with shortened arms and legs, or no limbs at all, issued its first ever apology last Friday - 50 years after pulling the drug off the market.Gruenenthal Group's chief executive said the company wanted to apologise to mothers who took the drug during the 1950s and 1960s and to their children who suffered congenital birth defects as a result.\"We ask for forgiveness that for nearly 50 years we didn't find a way of reaching out to you from human being to human being,\" Harald Stock said.\"We ask that you regard our long silence as a sign of the shock that your fate caused in us.\"Stock spoke in the west German city of Stolberg, where the company is based, during the unveiling of a bronze statue symbolising a child born without limbs because of thalidomide.The statue is called 'the sick child' - a name German victims group object to since all the victims are now adults.

However, this financial year the CDF for each MP was cut by $5 million to $15 million, with Fagan allocating only $2.5 of his to education, warning failing students to buckle down or lose this assistance.He told them: \"Some of the students here are not doing very well in school and ... students, parents, grandparents, guardians ... it is not my intention to support students who waste time. I want to help all of you going forward, but I cannot afford to help those who are wasting time.\"Explaining that in his two decades as a politician this was one of the most challenging years facing Jamaica and the rest of the world, Fagan appealed to the youngsters to help him to continue helping them.Said he: \"Children, some of you see how hard your parents and grandparents have to be working to ensure that you have a good life. For heavens sake, go to school and do your best.\"Addressing a packed auditorium Fagan used the example of a water tank filled with the precious liquid to show the constraints of how much he could do with the limited  CDF resources.\"The money I have for back to school is like that tank with water and everybody want a little,\" argued Fagan. \"I can't give one man half of the drum and can't give another five buckets because there is going to be another man who don't have enough to quench his thirst or to cook a little food, so when it done it done.\"For this reason, Fagan blasted the parents, guardians and other caregivers who fail to properly supervise the youngsters in their charge in order to ensure that they make the best use of their school time. Explaining that he personally reads the report cards, the MP said he had observed that while some students had a 100 per cent attendance record, this was inconsistent with their failing grades. Upon checking the caregivers for an explanation of the disparity, the veteran politician said it was a common thread that instead of helping them to focus on their lessons or work out the problems, in most cases parents were finding excuses for the children.Blasting these caregivers for their lackadaisical approach, the politician said that this failure to help the children get on track would result in them losing the financial support since this was contingent on good grades.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7181, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/63a2016a8de160c2", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:12.093", "title": "'We have lost a great deal'", "occurred_at": "2012-09-02T03:18:41", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120901/lead/lead4.html", "data": "Family awaits autopsy on man who died on planeJanet Silvera, Senior Gleaner WriterWESTERN BUREAU:All Joseph A. MacWade wanted to do was to come home to Jamaica. But, the 83-year-old didn't make it further than the Providenciales airport, Turks and Caicos, where he was pronounced dead on board a Caribbean Airlines flight en route from New York to Jamaica last Sunday.The aircraft was forced to be diverted to Turks and Caicos, owing to MacWade's condition on the flight. The situation worsened cutting the elderly man's journey short.\"My aunt brought him to the airport in New York and everything seemed fine. He was happy and relaxed. Several hours later, she got a phone call saying he had died. We have lost a great deal,\" said MacWade's niece, Christine MacWade.While uncertain of the circumstances surrounding her uncle's death, MacWade revealed that officials in the Turks and Caicos were conducting a thorough investigation into the death. \"They will send their report to the family when it is completed.\"In the meantime, it is almost a week since the body has been in the Turks and Caicos awaiting an autopsy. \"They said the doctor would be back on the island sometime today (yesterday). I don't know if they will get the autopsy done right away or if it might take longer. We are hoping he will be in Kingston by Monday,\" she said.Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, MacWade has lived in Jamaica for the past 40 years.He completed his philosophy and theology studies at Weston College and spent three years of regency in Baghdad, both as a student of Arabic and a teacher of English. He was ordained at Weston in 1961. After tertiary education at Pomfret, Connecticut, he studied canon law at the Oriental Institute in Rome from 1963 until 1966 when he returned to Baghdad to teach ethics and theology at Al Hikma University. When the Jesuits were forced to leave Baghdad in 1968, MacWade returned to Rome to finish his doctoral work. He received his degree in 1972. In that year, MacWade was commmissioned to Jamaica, where he first taught theology at St Michael's Seminary and the University of the West Indies.\"He then happily accepted a new role in Jamaica as high school teacher and, for the remainder of his career, became extremely involved at Campion College, heading up the religion department, serving as a religion teacher, running retreats, and animating the spiritual life of the students, while continuing to serve as a canon lawyer for the Archdiocese of Kingston,\" said Christine MacWade.janet.silvera@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7182, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/48995855af1f9850", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:12.565", "title": "Cops on trial to return to court on September 17", "occurred_at": "2012-09-02T03:18:41", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120901/lead/lead41.html", "data": "The eight policemen who are on trial for allegedly refusing to cooperate with the Independent Commission of Investigations (INDECOM) are to return to the Corporate Area Resident Magistrate's Court on September 17.INDECOM had served notices on the men to give statements in relation to the shooting death of two persons in Tredegar Park, St Catherine.The trial began on Tuesday and was to continue on Thursday, but had to be put off because it was reported that Senior Resident Magistrate Georgianna Fraser, who is trying the case, was ill.An investigator with INDECOM testified on Tuesday that he served notices on the policemen to attend an identification parade and answer questions, but they did not comply.He was cross-examined by defence lawyers Valerie Neita-Robertson, Christopher Townsend and Peter Champagnie who are representing the policemen.The policemen are Orrette Williamson, Gerville Williams, Francis Rennalls, Devon Noble, David Hutchinson, Petro Green, Marcel Dixon and Kenneth Daley.

It was completed in the 1750s and named Fort Augusta in honour of the mother of King George III.In 1763, lightning struck the fort and its 3,000 barrels of gunpowder, causing an explosion that broke windows 17 miles away and killed 300 people. The shocks created a crater which had to be filled before reconstruction could begin.Nowadays, the remains of the fortress consist of massive crumbling walls of brick that have been fortified with other materials (including barbed wire), and have been used for decades as a prison for women.

I hardly think the hotel was ever used, and clearly, the stadium is not being fully utilised.The talk about downtown Kingston restoration and redevelopment has been going on for well over a decade now.From the very outset, there were complaints and murmurings, from many transport operators and commuters alike, about the location of the downtown bus park. Due consideration was not given, or there was not a well-thought-out plan in place before this project was commissioned.We have seen where the autho-rity of the day started running around to find some sort of quick-fix solution to the problems that were highlighted after it was opened. I would like to think that the search is still going on.However, my contention is not where the centre is located. In my opinion, this location was suitable, smack between the commercial and industrial region of the city.Nevertheless, I think that other infrastructural developments needed to have been put in place, including the expansion of the Darling Street Police Station into a joint military/police base. This would have given commuters and operators the assurance that their security would not be compromised.Furthermore, the surrounding locale should be fully urbanised, so that in traversing the area, one does not feel a sense of isolation which can cause fear and anxiety, especially among some of the more vulnerable, such as young children and the elderly.law enforcementSecond, the enforcement of the law is most crucial for the survival of any society. Lawlessness can only lead to turmoil, which in turn will retard economic growth and development. Therefore, the authority must do due diligence to ensure that all and sundry comply with the rules and regulations that govern the land. Thus, if the terminus is where commuting should commence and terminate, it must be enforced.Notwithstanding, I must point out what I think is a disparity between the Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC) and other public transportation providers. It is very unreasonable to have allowed the JUTC buses to remain at Parade, while compelling the rest of operators to go to Water Lane. All buses and taxis should converge in the same precinct, so that no one can complain that they are being disenfranchised.Crocodile danger in Black RiverCharles Peterccwpeter@hotmail.comRecently, my family and I went on a tour of the Black River, conducted by one of the safari operators there. I will not disclose the location of this operator, as I hope same will read this letter and take the obvious measures based on my concern.Between the administrative building of the safari and the Black River bank, there is a strip of lawn about four metres wide. At the end of this strip of lawn is a gate with a sign which states that individuals are not to proceed further. At the time of my visit, this gate had two horizontal spaces at its base approximately 70 centimetres high by one metre wide, through which either a crocodile or someone could easily pass through.On same visit, I walked to this gate and followed the instruction not to proceed further. Located about six metres beyond this gate was what I thought was a plastic model of an adult crocodile lying with its jaws opened wide. I returned to the location on the river bank where members of my family and others boarded the boat on which we would take the river tour.The captain of the boat pulled up quietly beside what I thought previously was a model of a crocodile and to my shock and dismay learnt that this was no model but a LIVE crocodile!very dangerousI consider having the gate between where this crocodile was located and the other section of this complex, having the mentioned spaces, grossly crazy, as an unsupervised child could have easily strayed to the location of this crocodile and possibly be killed by it!I pray that the relevant authority will have this matter immediately investigated and addressed if to date the spaces in that gate still exist. Explanations given by the captain of our tour boat simply made no sense to me and others who were on the trip. It would be a terrible tragedy if a child or someone else was killed by a crocodile who ventured through the mentioned spaces in the fence or otherwise.Chalky Hill road still needs fixing!Robert G.F.

Additionally, how many millions to 'celebrate' our 50th birthday? Sure, celebrate - but to that extent?Where are the priorities? Surely, the glaring and outstanding needs of Jamaica's education, health, security and infrastructure systems should be considered ahead of feel-good missions and celebrations.A case in point: Speaking of infrastructure, has the NWA abandoned the six-kilometre section of the Chalky Hill, St Ann, roadway between Golden Grove via Steerfield to Thickets (Trafalgar)? This corridor is the major trucking and passenger transportation roadway between north and south Jamaica. The road surface has been, for the past 18 months, in a deplorable and unsafe condition.patching not enoughThank God for the Knutsford Express, which provided some marl patching relief in June 2012 - now washed away by the recent rains. The resulting daily delays experienced and the constant and costly damage to heavy transport equipment and passenger vehicles is staggering - yet the pleas for help over months - and months - go unanswered!Surely, Finance Minister Peter Phillips and MP (North East St Ann) Lisa Hanna would appreciate that the Chalky Hill roadway is typical of the outstanding priorities that exist throughout Jamaica and should take precedence over the extent of Government's recent expenditures for London and Independence.Please, no 'Mammy' bags roun' 'ere!Nicholas D. McdavidPO Box 20, Kgn 6nicholas.mcdavid@gmail.comI would like to bring to your attention the picture taken on my BlackBerry Saturday, August 25, 2012. The picture is of a 'Jamaica'-branded item that is for sale at Sun Island Jamaica stores, with particular reference to the outlet at 45 Molynes Road, Kingston 10.The image is of a 'mammy', which is one of the most, if not the ultimate, racist stereotype of black women, dating somewhere from the 1930s upwards in terms of 'iconic popularity'. This image was a portrayal that black women's roles were to be that of household servants and the like.I naturally felt strongly about something like this being sold by Sun Island Jamaica, and I asked one of the cashiers how she felt about the image. She had no answer at first. I then asked if she considered herself a black woman, to which she answered and assured, \"Yes.\"I then put to her that the same image would be like saying all black women are monkeys because they like bananas. She accepted the example completely.It is my plight, therefore, to raise some kind of awareness to our countrymen and women.Some type of alarm should be going off at one seeing something like this! I said to a family member that selling a 'mammy' item, especially one that is branded 'Jamaica' in Jamaica, would be the same as selling an Adolf Hitler T-shirt in a Jewish neighbourhood in Brooklyn, New York. It simply wouldn't be allowed to happen or continue!Maybe there might be some who think I am overreacting, but I would never have written if it was not something that completely rubbed me the wrong way. I think it is a cultural insult, especially being outside of an arena or explanation that is culturally and historically contextual to the image.Tell us about the positives and negatives affecting your community, school or any other social space.

We just want to know that he is safe,\" she said.\"We have been sending around his pictures asking everybody to pray for him; we have been sending around (a description of) his car and his licence number asking everybody if they see it to let us know,\" she revealed.livern.barrett@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7103, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bf278242e3e03cc8", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:43:15.396", "title": "'Aabuthnott Gallimore High admin won't give in'", "occurred_at": "2012-09-09T06:08:30", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120908/lead/lead62.html", "data": "Carl Gilchrist, Gleaner WriterALEXANDRIA, St Ann:It was a tough price to pay, but the attack on Gavin Myers, dean of discipline of the Aabuthnott Gallimore High School, seems to have started a trend of disciplined behaviour at the Alexandria, St Ann, school.Myers was attacked by five students in April and was hospitalised with several stab wounds and a broken leg. He was attacked after he tried to get the boys who were on suspension off the school compound.Myers returned to active duty at the school in July, although he has not fully recovered from the incident.Speaking with The Gleaner on Thursday, principal Geoffrey Sharpe said there has been a change for the better since that troubling incident.\"I wouldn't say we are squeaky clean now, but that incident has brought a sobering effect to the school,\" Sharpe said. \"There used to be little skirmishes. We don't see a lot of that anymore. A sort of calm has come over the school. It seems students are doing a lot of introspection and it is playing out in their behaviour. So the situation is much improved.\"Sharpe said since classes resumed on Monday, several students had been turned away because of violations of the dress code. While the occurrence might be a daily one, Sharpe said it has been noted that it was the same set of students, mainly boys, who kept turning up and expecting to be admitted to school while in violation of the dress code.Sharpe said the administration is firm in its stance to have students abide by the rules.\"We don't plan to give in. Rules must be respected, so we're putting down our foot,\" he said. Sharpe added that he was happy the education ministry had taken a supportive stance on the issue.The five boys charged with wounding with intent and assault occasioning grievous bodily harm, arising from the attack on Myers, are to return to court on September 24.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7104, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3b8c6a41d22480d7", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:43:15.836", "title": "'Don't turn back the children '", "occurred_at": "2012-09-09T06:08:30", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120908/lead/lead7.html", "data": "Nedburn Thaffe, Gleaner WriterThe National Parent-Teachers Association of Jamaica (NPTAJ) president has called on school administrators to ease up on the stance taken against tight-pants-wearing students and others found in breach of school dress codes.The newly installed president, Everton Hannam, said that while students have an obligation to adhere to dress codes laid down by school administrators, turning them away for not adhering to the rules must be a last resort.\"There must be a procedure before we come to that. It would be best that a location is found at the school to have them there for the day and administer whatever disciplinary measures. We wouldn't want to have children turned back to go back on the street.

We cannot go into the future with the current laws,\" said Hylton.The minister was speaking yesterday at The Knutsford Court Hotel in St Andrew during a breakfast forum addressing the reformation proposals for the new Insolvency Act. It was held under the theme 'Booms Need Busts: Reforming Insolvency Legislation'.Hylton stated that according to the 2012 World Bank business report, resolving insolvencies in Jamaica takes one and a half years and costs 18 per cent of the debtor's estate. The report further said the average recovery rate was 65.3 per cent on the dollar.\"A modern bankruptcy and insolvency law is not only essential in the creation of a favourable business environment, but is also necessary to the stability of our financial system,\" he added.Hylton said he was hoping to have the new act implemented by next year.The current law on personal bankruptcy is found in the Bankruptcy Act of 1880, while the corporate insolvency provisions in the Companies Act 2004 are based on the provisions of the United Kingdom Companies Act of 1948.According to Suzanne Ffolkes Goldson, the current bankruptcy law is \"quasi-criminal\" and appears to have \"punishment as its main objective\".\"The current insolvency regime is time-consuming and costly, creates stigma, creates little or no provision for rescue and rehabilitation of the business and affairs of the debtor, and consists of very few specialists,\" Ffolkes Goldson stated.business conceptCaydion Campbell, senior manager in the deals practice of PricewaterhouseCoopers, noted that \"oftentimes, the insolvent situation is a result of a good business concept poorly executed.

Its power also rests in simplicity; it must leave space upon which one can lay one's own narrative. Puma's latest ad now blanketing the streets of Kingston is an example.With the tagline 'And then Jamaica conquered England' acting as the foundation and a flag-clad Usain Bolt staring to the future, the ad has created a buzz on social media.The reasons for the ad's success are numerous. It is the contrast of a pensive and solitary young man set against the way we usually see him: gallivanting, posing, dominating. Visually, its stark white background contrasts with what usually surrounds Bolt: a stadium of roaring fans, the media's flashing bulbs, and the red rubber of the track.Because to be sure, the image of an exuberant, supremely confident Bolt celebrating his Olympic record-breaking feats with his signature lightning pose is now iconic. The 26-year-old Bolt is the epitome of success: a finely honed human being at his absolute peak, giving a performance that is the result of unparalleled talent, unmatched hard work and unsurpassed dedication.The use of Bolt's image, captured from behind, is also powerful, as it positions consumers as observers: we are watching a young man ponder his future. Where can he go from here? What more can he achieve?For Jamaicans, he need not achieve anything else. As far as citizens are concerned, he is a hero on par with Bob Marley or Jimmy Cliff. Jamaicans are eagerly awaiting his return, so much so that there is a cry for a national holiday to celebrate his achievements, as well as those of his teammates, who, combined, won 12 Olympic medals.The Jamaican athletics team's performance reinforced in this nation a confidence already lodged in its psyche, but that has been challenged by social problems like unemployment, crime and financial difficulties.More than celebrationHowever, Puma's ad strikes deeper than an ecstatic celebration of sporting victory and the claim of the title of the fastest man in the world.With its reference to the complicated and heart-wrenching relationship between these nations, Puma has evoked the history of colonisation.Look, the ad whispers, you conquered our land, now we conquer your culture, your sports and a title of global excellence. And we did it in a civilised, modern fashion using the universal language of sport and culture.Perhaps the Puma executives had in mind a poem from Louise Bennett Coverley, another beloved Jamaican who celebrated the nation's culture and embraced the use of Patois. Here's an excerpt from a Bennett poem.An week by week dem shippin offDem countryman like fire,Fe immigrate an populateDe seat a de Empire.Oonoo see how life is funny,Oonoo see de tunabout?The poem paints the picture of the challenges and opportunities faced by Jamaican immigrants as they make a new life in the UK. This story is ongoing, as the ad references: \"And then Jamaica conquered England.\" This statement begs a precedent sentence, with the intuitive phrase being \"England conquered Jamaica.\"Thus, another layer of brilliance to Puma's ad: the effects of colonialism continue to impact everything from culture to international relations to sports. But with Bolt's win, Jamaica has written a new chapter to the story.katespchappell@gmail.comConcerned about TRN useMAVIS FERGUSONIn recent weeks I have been having some concerns about the number of places I go and am required to provide my tax registration number (TRN), as well as the number of parents/guardians who have asked me to sign documents because they are applying for a TRN for their under-18-year-old child.With these in mind, I went to the Tax Administration website to find out the purpose of a TRN and saw the following:Q. Why TRN?A:The TRN system facilitates Government's computerisation programme for the revenue departments, and aid in improving tax administration and provide better service to the public. TRN provides more reliable information to taxpayers regarding their accounts and will eventually become taxpayers' driver's licence number upon application for a driver's licence.Q. How will TRN help taxpayers?A: Through the elimination of varied numbers and duplicated information used by the revenue departments for the same taxpayer. [And] To create and maintain accurate files for taxpayers for easy retrieval on taxpayers' files.Who needs a TRN?A:a. All taxpayers, including those who do business with revenue departments.b. Businesses and other organisations.Having noted this, I still do not understand why the TRN is needed for persons who are not working or for non-tax matters. I understand that employers and related agencies would need it for tax purposes, but for other places I don't understand. Is there a law that protects me or prohibits those who want it for these 'other reasons', especially because 'everybody else is asking for it'?The other big question is why a child who can't and does not pay taxes needs a TRN. And if children are eligible for one, why can't they apply on their own strength but parents/guardians have to apply on their behalf.I have heard it said that Jamaica wants the TRN to be like a Social Security card as in the USA. If this is correct, it needs to be properly investigated, because there are consequences.What we do not know is that there are many children who are indebted before they are old enough to get a job because adults put them there because of this number. The same can be applicable here, if a child is not able to work to pay taxes, what is the purpose of a TRN for those under age 18 years.I will also dare to ask what is the purpose of a TRN for every little transaction you do, especially now that we have learnt that TRNs and driver's licence are being falsified.The other observation is that a number of organisations are using TRN as staff/members' number. Can any organisation take on to itself and decide to use a TRN as a critical piece of information to be included on, for example, a work ID without permission from the relevant government body?TRNs are not supposed to be free-for-all information and should only be disclosed in critical matters.mythoughtsforyours@gmail.comMore buses needed for schoolchildrenMark BellHarbour View, Kingston 17Why is it that on Wednesday, September 5, 2012, when most schools were reopened, some children were left stranded at bus stops.I think the relevant authority should ensure that enough buses are out, especially on the first week of the new school year.I drove past Windward Road, East Queen Street, Orange Street, Molynes Road, Washington Boulevard and the bus stops were full.Since the relevant authority is on the verge of getting the illegal taxis, better known as 'robots', off the streets, in the meantime they should make provisions for enough bus on the routes.It hurts to see so many children at the bus stops looking so desperate to get transportation to school. I am appealing to the relevant authority to put measures in place so that the children can get to school on time in the mornings.mark.bellphoto@hotmail.comDevelopment, not 'dough'CELTIC GODSPaul H.

Currently, Jamaica has established the CCJ in its original jurisdiction, to deal with trade matters, and the Government has placed legislation before Parliament to have the court established in its appellate jurisdiction. To bolster his argument, Wildman pointed to a study he claimed was done by a reputable international law firm which showed that the Privy Council has overturned 62 per cent of the appeals that came from Jamaica. \"Having practised in other jurisdictions in the Caribbean, I am even more fortified in saying that I don't think that we have reached the level that we should now go and abolish the Privy Council at this time,\" Wildman said. But in a swift response, Atkinson defended Jamaican jurists, declaring the country's standard of justice matches favourably \"with any one of them\". \"I reject completely any suggestion that the decisions coming out of our courts are inferior to decisions coming out of the English courts,\" he stressed. \"I absolutely reject it. I think it is unfair, I think it is untrue and I don't think it is based on any kind of statistics or careful study,\" insisted Atkinson. Opposition Spokesman on National Security and Justice Delroy Chuck also distanced himself from Wildman's comments. \"I don't agree with my friend Hugh Wildman that we don't have persons of intellectual brilliance ... and indeed some of the judgments out of the Caribbean Court of Justice are quite good judgments,\" Chuck said. Former Public Defender Howard Hamilton also sided with Chuck and Atkinson. Way below standard But Wildman stuck to his argument, citing a recent case in Guyana. \"It was generally considered that that judgment was way below standard and we can't accept that as representing the standard that should be accepted in the region in so far as commercial matters are concerned,\" Wildman said. Chuck agreed that the ruling in that case was \"poor\", but said \"the fact that a poor judgment was delivered (doesn't mean) everything is bad\".

Currently, Jamaica has established the CCJ in its original jurisdiction, to deal with trade matters, and the Government has placed legislation before Parliament to have the court established in its appellate jurisdiction. To bolster his argument, Wildman pointed to a study he claimed was done by a reputable international law firm which showed that the Privy Council has overturned 62 per cent of the appeals that came from Jamaica. \"Having practised in other jurisdictions in the Caribbean, I am even more fortified in saying that I don't think that we have reached the level that we should now go and abolish the Privy Council at this time,\" Wildman said. But in a swift response, Atkinson defended Jamaican jurists, declaring the country's standard of justice matches favourably \"with any one of them\". \"I reject completely any suggestion that the decisions coming out of our courts are inferior to decisions coming out of the English courts,\" he stressed. \"I absolutely reject it. I think it is unfair, I think it is untrue and I don't think it is based on any kind of statistics or careful study,\" insisted Atkinson. Opposition Spokesman on National Security and Justice Delroy Chuck also distanced himself from Wildman's comments. \"I don't agree with my friend Hugh Wildman that we don't have persons of intellectual brilliance ... and indeed some of the judgments out of the Caribbean Court of Justice are quite good judgments,\" Chuck said. Former Public Defender Howard Hamilton also sided with Chuck and Atkinson. Way below standard But Wildman stuck to his argument, citing a recent case in Guyana. \"It was generally considered that that judgment was way below standard and we can't accept that as representing the standard that should be accepted in the region in so far as commercial matters are concerned,\" Wildman said. Chuck agreed that the ruling in that case was \"poor\", but said \"the fact that a poor judgment was delivered (doesn't mean) everything is bad\". Wildman urged regional governments to be careful they were not trying to replace the Privy Council \"just for the notion of decolonisation\". \"(Just) to say that we have replaced the Queen. What is important is that at the end of the day, the people would want to know that if you are going to replace the Privy Council, you are going to replace it with a court that is on equal standing or close to being equal, not an inferior court,\" he continued.

We need the CDA to outline its roles and responsibilities in relation to children in conflict of the law, particularly so that we can know where to go to when issues like this arise,\" said Carolyn Gomes, executive director of Jamaicans for Justice.Last week, The Gleaner reported that the 14-year-old murder accused from the community of Southside, central Kingston, had given birth reportedly for an adult male in the community.There have been conflicting reports from the CDA and attorney for the teen, Elham Bogle, regarding the CDA's knowledge of the teen's pregnancy and involvement in her monitoring.Among the issues the groups said they needed clarity on were:\u0095 The responsibility of the CDA to all juveniles in conflict with the law, including those before the courts and on bail;\u0095 The role of the CDA in the evaluation and monitoring of juvenile detention facilities;\u0095 The role of the CDA in the evaluation and monitoring of juvenile offenders;\u0095 The role the CDA plays, if any, in the training of correction officers and wardens to deal with juvenile offenders;\u0095 The responsibility of the CDA, if any, to juveniles housed at adult correctional facilities such as Horizon and Fort Augusta.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7123, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/07584d83e709faf0", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:43:31.664", "title": "MPs shun committee meetings", "occurred_at": "2012-09-07T06:01:13", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120906/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Daraine Luton, Senior Staff ReporterTHE VAST majority of parliamentarians have been failing to show up for legislative duties in committees.Lecturer in management studies at the University of the West Indies, Dr Densil Williams, after perusing the attendance records of committees for the just-concluded parliamentary session, which ran from May to August, said the level of absenteeism of members of the house in the various subcommittees of Parliament is cause for concern.Of the six house committees that met during the period under review, only two members who sit on more than one committee had flawless attendance records.The two - Arnaldo Brown and Dr Andrew Wheatley - are members of the Internal and External Affairs Committee and Ethics Committee. Both committees had a single meeting over the period.Like Brown and Wheatley, Hugh Buchanan and Delroy Chuck serve on both committees. Buchanan did not show up for the lone meeting of each while Chuck was absent from the meeting of the Internal and External Affairs Committee.\"It is at the subcommittee level that most of the operational details on policy development should be deliberated on. It means that these committees should be most active and vibrant if they are to articulate appropriate policies to guide the management of the state,\" Williams told The Gleaner.He added: \"The lack of meetings and the high level of absenteeism seem to suggest that policy development and articulation are outsourced to the bureaucracy and legislators are more concerned with other affairs than those of policy development and articulation.\"Daley almost flawlessDenise Daley, who sits on four committees, has missed only one of a possible 12 meetings. She has never been absent for the seven meetings of the CDF committee, was absent from one of the two Public Administration and Appropriations Committee meetings, attended all of the three Human Resource and Social Development Committee meetings as well as the lone meeting of the Internal and External Affairs Committee.Daley told The Gleaner that as a first-time MP, she has made it her duty to attend the committee meetings because it provides her with an opportunity to better understand the parliamentary process.\"The committees are also important because it is the level where you are able to consider and deliberate on policies. And as a representative of the people, it is my duty to provide such representation,\" Daley said.Mikael Phillips was absent three times from 10 possible meetings held by three committees and Everald Warmington absent once from nine possible meetings held by two committees.But that was as far as the excellent attendance record goes. Hugh Buchanan and Andr\u00e9 Hylton, for example, have been perennial absentees from committees.The two committees on which Hylton sits met a total of eight times - (the CDF seven times and the Ethics Committee once) and he has attended only two meetings.In the case of Buchanan, who sits on the Internal and External Affairs, the Human Resource and Social Development and the Ethics committees, the South West St Elizabeth MP has attended none of the combined five meetings of the three committees on which he sits.Like Buchanan, Keith Walford and Anthony Hylton failed to attend a single meeting of the Human Resource and Social Development Committee. Marisa Dalrymple-Philibert, Shahine Robinson and Olivia Grange attended only one of the three meetings held.Robinson, however, has a flawless attendance record at the CDF, in much the same way Daley, Joylan Silvera and Rudyard Spencer have flawless attendance records at the Human Resource and Social Development Committee.The Human Resource and Social Development Committee considered the issue of whether the Office of the Political Ombudsman should be abolished.The Public Administration and Approriations Committee also suffered from poor attendance. The committee, which is charged with monitoring the expenditure of government entities and to make recommendations for the improvement of public administration, had only two meetings over the period. Of the 13 members on the committee, only Edmund Bartlett, who chairs the committee, Fitz Jackson, Richard Parchment and Mikael Phillips attended all meetings.Neither Raymond Pryce, Audley Shaw, Lloyd B. Smith nor Dr Dayton Campbell showed up for any of the two meetings of the Public Administration and Approriations Committee.Clearly a failureArguing that legislators are like directors of the company, Williams said, \"With so many of its directors not showing up for meetings and so many meetings not held, the company would collapse and eventually close its operations.\"\"In terms of governance, this performance is clearly a failure,\" he added.He said Parliament could not afford to be missing sessions of meetings aimed at articulating clear policy positions for carrying the country forward.\"If the members of the committees are not up to the task, they should be replaced with more committed persons so that there can be serious deliberations on the critical issues affecting the nation at this time,\" Williams said.In the meantime, Campbell told The Gleaner that he considers the parliamentary committees \"paramount to nation building\".\"I take it as a pleasure and a privilege to serve on three such committees. This is an opportunity to make a meaningful contribution and, as such, I try my endeavour best to always be in attendance and to always be well prepared,\" Campbell told The Gleaner.Campbell was absent from six of 12 possible meetings of three committees.\"I was unavoidable absent from a few sittings secondary to a concerted effort I made to attend as many of the graduation ceremonies in my constituency, I was able to attend all three for secondary schools and 15 of 26 for the primary schools. I also sat my LLB exams in May, which compounded the problem.\"He told The Gleaner that it is his desire to \"maintain an attendance record of greater than 90 per cent whilst not neglecting my responsibilities to my beloved constituency of St Ann North Western.\"daraine.luton@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7124, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3ee47021b5aa9c28", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:43:32.123", "title": "No discord over bribery case, says DPP", "occurred_at": "2012-09-07T06:01:13", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120906/lead/lead6.html", "data": "Livern Barrett, Gleaner WriterDirector of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Paula Llewellyn says there is no discord in her office over the bribery case involving three high-profile Jamaicans.Llewellyn's assertion came hours after she went to the Corporate Area Resident Magistrate's Court yesterday to clear up the \"confusion in the public domain\" over whether Police Commissioner Owen Ellington was required to give a statement in the case.On August 22, Dirk Harrison, a senior deputy DPP and the lead prosecutor in the case, told the court that \"based on some intelligence we have, we need a statement from the commissioner\".But yesterday Llewellyn told Resident Magistrate Georgianna Fraser that Harrison's comments were not the official position of her office and later, in an interview with The Gleaner, sought to allay concerns about discord over the issue.\"We operate as a team and we have always operated as a team,\" Llewellyn said.The DPP told the court that Ellington would not be required to give a statement, revealing that an examination of the statements collected by investigators show that any mention of him was \"extremely brief\".\"It would not be of any assistance to the prosecution to have a statement from the commissioner,\" she said.Seeking to explain Harrison's statement to the court on August 22, the DPP told Fraser he was \"merely relaying information gleaned from the investigators\".Independent assessmentShe later told The Gleaner her office gives due consideration to the opinion of police investigators, but made it clear \"we reserve the right to exercise our independent assessment in order to mount a viable prosecution\".Llewellyn said this was her view from the outset when she first discussed the case with Harrison and another deputy, Lisa Palmer Hamilton.However, she said she did not have a chance to discuss the case with Harrison before he went to court.Businessman Bruce Bicknell, who is already facing a charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice, was also charged yesterday with bribery.Parliamententarian Daryl Vaz has been charged with breaches of the Corruption Prevention Act, while Senior Superintendent of Police James Forbes has been charged with attempting to pervert the court of justice.They are scheduled to return to court on October 3.livern.barrett@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7125, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d29bb65069921a2d", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:43:32.591", "title": "Cops question Clover Graham murder suspect", "occurred_at": "2012-09-07T06:01:13", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120906/lead/lead7.html", "data": "Glenroy Sinclair, Assignment CoordinatorPolice investigating the brutal murder of university lecturer and attorney-at-law Clover Graham were yesterday questioning a deportee as they continue to probe the killing which stunned the legal fraternity three weeks ago.\"Yes, somebody was taken into custody.

to nominate Barack Obama for a second White House term last night, an unusual move by a Democratic Party determined to lift the spirits of voters who have lived through the worst downturn since the Great Depression.Obama's challenger, businessman-turned-politician Mitt Romney, is seen by voters as better qualified to manage the country's still-struggling economic recovery. Clinton has been assigned to change that.Polls find Americans evenly split in what looks to be the closest US presidential election in recent memory. While the multimillionaire Romney has an edge on economic issues, Obama is seen as better able to relate to the needs of ordinary Americans.Indoor acceptance speechThe president arrived in the Democratic National Convention city yesterday afternoon as he decided not to deliver his acceptance speech tonight at a 74,000-seat outdoor arena, citing bad weather. Instead, he'll accept the nomination indoors at the convention site, which holds 15,000.The shift ensured there would be no repeat of the extraordinary scene from 2008 when Obama accepted the Democratic nomination in a packed 84,000-seat stadium.Republicans asked whether the venue change was for other reasons. \"Problems filling the seats?\" Republican spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said in a statement.Star powerThe president and his two daughters watched from the White House on Tuesday night as First Lady Michelle Obama ended the convention's opening night with star power and a deeply personal, yet unmistakably political testimonial.\"I have seen first-hand that being president doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are,\" she said to huge cheers.The first lady took the stage as the most popular figure in this year's presidential campaign. Michelle Obama earns higher favourability ratings than her husband or Romney, according to the latest Associated Press-GfK poll. And views of her tilt favourably among independents and women, two focal points in her husband's campaign for re-election.She declared that after nearly four years as president, her husband is still the man who drove a rusty car on their early dates, rescued a coffee table from the trash and knows the struggles of everyday Americans because he lived them.Romney was formally nominated at the Republican convention last week. His name appeared nowhere in Mrs Obama's remarks, but there was no mistaking the contrast she was drawing. She declared that \"how hard you work matters more than how much you make, that helping others means more than just getting ahead yourself\".\u00a0\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7129, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/94f54c487b5d8ab9", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:43:39.410", "title": "CDA knew of 'slackness'", "occurred_at": "2012-09-07T06:01:13", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120905/lead/lead1.html", "data": "Anastasia Cunningham, News CoordinatorAgency admits knowledge of 14-y-o murder accused's pregnancyThe attorney for a 14-year-old girl on trial for murder, who gave birth last week, has raised concerns about how the Child Development Agency (CDA) monitors criminal juveniles, after revealing that the agency misled the public when it claimed it had no knowledge of the pregnancy or involvement in the case.\"I personally wrote a letter to CDA advising them that she was pregnant after I was assigned the case last year,\" attorney-at-law Elham Bogle told The Gleaner yesterday.\"They went to her house and left a message that she was to visit them and when she went, no one (at the CDA) knew about it, and they called me and I told them that someone had come to the house from CDA. So I am at a loss now that they are saying they weren't aware. In fact, it was obvious she was pregnant at each court appearance.\"Last week, after The Gleaner revealed the girl had given birth, Dahlia Cole, CDA public relations officer, had told the newspaper that although the agency was aware of the murder case, it was never formally brought into the matter. Cole had said it was not until The Gleaner story was published that the agency became aware that the child was pregnant.But yesterday, while dismissing Bogle's claim that she had informed the CDA of the pregnancy, the agency admitted it misinformed the public when it said it was never aware the girl was expecting. The CDA now says it became aware of the pregnancy in July.SEVERE BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMSBogle, who is representing the teen in the murder case, said in addition to the CDA, the Family Court was aware and referred the child to a clinical psychologist at the Bustamante Hospital for Children for severe behavioural problems. She said the CDA had written the referral letter early this year.Bogle said she was told by the 14-year-old that the father of her child had been shot to death. But, because of other information provided by the girl, the attorney said she was not sure she knew who the baby's father really is.\"When I brought this up in court last month, the resident magistrate said that CISOCA (Centre for the Investigation of Sexual Offences and Child Abuse) may have a case against the father,\" Bogle said.The teen gave birth at the Victoria Jubilee Hospital in Kingston last Wednesday.She was living with her mother in the community of Southside in Central Kingston.When The Gleaner visited her community the day she gave birth, upset residents were in a heated discussion about the matter and called for the CDA to get involved.\"This is slackness! Dem must coulda check her out an mek sure she under control!\" one irate woman had declared.Yesterday, Bogle said the child's mother could not understand \"why she behaves like that\".ASSISTANCE SOUGHT FROM CDAThe attorney said the teen was in dire need of assistance for herself and the infant.\"The mother is not in any job, as such, and myself and the counsellor at Family Court have been giving her money, but we can only assist to a certain point. I also wrote CDA and the United Way asking for assistance,\" said Bogle.She added: \"Frankly, I don't see what role the CDA serves. I mean, in what circumstance should we call them?\"In a statement last night, the CDA said the information it provided to The Gleaner and which was published last Friday \"was not entirely correct\".\"Subsequent to the report, we received additional information from our South East Regional Office which indicated otherwise,\" Prudence Barnes, CDA's public relations manager, told The Gleaner.Barnes noted, however, that it was at the court appearance in July that it was noticed that the child was in an advanced state of pregnancy.\"The judge deemed her to be in need of care and protection because she was 14 years of age, and, therefore, under the age of consent. The judge then placed her on a supervision order, which means that the child is placed in the care of relatives, and CDA supervises and monitors. This was the first time that the child was placed directly in the care of the CDA,\" said Barnes.She said prior to that, the teen was in family care and was on a criminal charge, so she would not have been in the care of the CDA.The teen is before the court on charges of murdering 21-year-old Crissann Wilson, also known as 'Angel', on July 21 last year.Wilson, who was two months pregnant at the time, was stabbed to death following a dispute with the teen.The teen's mother was also charged with conspiracy to murder and accessory after the fact to murder, but those charges were later dropped.The case is set to continue sometime in November.anastasia.cunningham@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7187, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a76cfa622d4df573", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:14.937", "title": "Digicel Foundation set to 'Take Back The Night'  ... with a 5K Night Run/Walk in aid of special needs", "occurred_at": "2012-09-02T03:18:41", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120831/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Alessandro Boyd, Gleaner Writer\tThe Digicel Foundation is continuing its mission to raise awareness around the special needs community in Jamaica with its latest initiative, the 'Digicel Foundation 5K Night Run/Walk in Aid of Special Needs'.Under the theme 'Take Back The Night', the Digicel Foundation's run/walk is being branded Jamaica's first-ever initiative of its kind to be staged at night.\"With 'Take Back The Night', we will seek to raise awareness and support of special needs and to alter perceptions about hosting events at night in downtown Kingston,\" executive director of Digicel Foundation, Samantha Chantrelle, told The Gleaner yesterday during the launch of the run/walk at the company's new downtown Kingston headquarters.\"Similarly, we want to redefine perceptions of persons living with special needs in Jamaica.\"The School for Therapy, Education and Parenting of Children with Multiple Disabilities (STEP) Centre, Jamaica Society for the Blind and the Jamaica Association for the Deaf are among the several institutions that will benefit from the initiative.Determination\"The special needs community is not embraced, that's the truth.

However, yesterday was the first time the agency became aware that the girl was pregnant, after The Gleaner reported that she had given birth.\"Despite the fact that her father had responsibility for her and the CDA was never brought in, now that she, being underage, has a child, especially for someone who is an adult, the CDA can step in,\" Cole said.\"Therefore, I can tell you that some intervention will take place. What that will be I cannot say at this stage. There is a court process that has to take place, but we now have to look at working with other partners to do what needs to be done in the best interest of the child.\"On Wednesday, the residents of Southside, central Kingston, were enraged and concerned about why the CDA had not been monitoring the teen since she was involved in a murder case.Probation officer's careCole said that under the section of the Child Care and Protecton Act dealing with 'Children in Conflict with the Law', children up to age 18 who have committed an offence and are brought before the court become the responsibility of the Department of Correctional Services and fall under the care and supervision of a probation officer.Unless the court stipulates that the child is in need of care and protection, the CDA is not brought in. However, if involved, the CDA then appoints a social worker to the case.In the case of a child being granted bail and placed in the custody of a parent or guardian, Cole said a person would have sole responsibility for the child and the state would not be involved unless the child was appointed a legal aid or a probation officer. However, the parent/guardian would have to adhere to the stipulations of the terms of the bail.Cole noted that another critical factor was that the CDA could not be aware of all situations that require intervention unless they were brought to its attention. In this case, she said, the residents of the community were aware that the teen was pregnant and therefore should have contacted the CDA.\"We do not have eyes everywhere, so we don't know everything. That is why it has to be a community effort,\" Cole stressed. \"If the residents know what is happening and don't report it, then the CDA can't be brought in. The law stipulates that we must report and each person has that responsibility to report if they suspect or know of a child in danger.\"She added: \"Don't wait until after the fact.

The schools are heartless,\" said the mother who asked that her last name not be used. \"It seems as if they are catering for only one set of people in society, so what will happen to the poor? Is it that they should sit and watch only the richer class excel?\"Janet said while she believed parents should pay for their children, the fees were far too high, especially at a time when tuition fees have been abolished in the public schools.\"The fees that the schools are charging are high, so if tuition wasn't abolished then what would happen if we were to pay for everything? Maybe we would have a lot of students who wouldn't be able to go to school,\" she added.A check by The Gleaner at some schools in the Corporate Area revealed that institutions are charging as high as $25,000.After the Government abolished tuition fees in secondary schools, many parents had expected a reprieve from exorbitant rates.But Clayton Hall, president of the Jamaica Teachers' Association, said the fees are charged based on the operational expenses at the different schools.PTA consultationHall argued that the fees were charged in consultation with the parents through the parent-teacher associations (PTAs).\"The different schools offer different programmes and as such, based on the cost of these programmes, the schools have to set these fees to compensate.\"If there is a concern with the auxiliary fees, then it should be rooted through the PTA because a group of parents will come together and determine that they want a particular programme and they are willing to finance it, but when new parents join they may find the cost exorbitant,\" he argued.Education Minister Ronald Thwaites also came out in defence of the schools.Alluding to two of the top high schools which are charging astronomical fees, which The Gleaner brought to his attention, Thwaites stressed that those schools were offering programmes of a high quality.\"What they charging the money for is very important. You can't just look at the funds. These schools offer extremely high-quality programmes and what the parent ought to do is to go to the school and ask for it to be set out in terms of what is it that is covered.\"The important thing is the figure and the affordability, but very importantly is what you getting for it,\" he said.President of the National Parent Teachers' Association, Everton Hannam, said the association was deeply concerned about how the schools arrive at the figures.Hannam said there should be a standard procedure that the schools should follow when they are arriving at the fees for the year.\"There should be some price range as to where those school fees should be so that at least there can be a uniformed approach to the charges and then there should be a payment plan as the fees are in addition to the booklist and the uniform,\" he said.The Ministry of Education issued a warning last week to school administrators that students on the Programme of Advancement Through Health and Education and wards of the state should not be barred from entering the institutions for the non-payment of auxiliary fees, instead they should be granted a waiver on auxiliary fees.nadisha.hunter@gleanerjm.comIf your child is barred from entering school on Monday as a result of a failure to pay auxiliary fees, contact Nadisha Hunter via email or at 932-6185.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7192, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/24df09a8be2a160d", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:17.915", "title": "Burger King serves up scholarships for students", "occurred_at": "2012-08-31T02:03:10", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120831/lead/lead7.html", "data": "Gary Spaulding, Senior Gleaner WriterAll eyes were focused admiringly on 19-year-old budding journalist Collette Campbell, out of St Andrew High School, and prospective medical doctor, 18-year-old former St George's College student Sheldon Edwards at The Jamaica Pegasus hotel in New Kingston yesterday.The two were the toasts of approximately 20 students at varying rungs of the education ladder who sparkled in their respective endeavours to cop awards at the Restaurant Associates Ltd/Burger King 2012 Scholarship Awards ceremony.Collette's performances in her Caribbean Advance Proficiency Examination (CAPE) earned her the coveted Lois Sherwood Scholarship.Sheldon copped the Rodwell Lake Scholarship that has catapulted him closer to his dream of becoming a surgeon.

Imagine, she pregnant while she a guh court and you a tell me nobody neva know?\" a neighbour of the teen added.The teen reportedly returned to her community after she was released on bail. According to the residents, she was in a relationship with an adult male, who is said to be the father of her child.Last year, the teen reportedly had an ongoing dispute with Wilson, who is also from the community. On the evening of Thursday, July 21, 2011, the two were on Tower Street in central Kingston when an argument developed. The teen, 13 at the time, reportedly stabbed Wilson in the neck.Wilson later died at the Kingston Public Hospital while undergoing treatment. The teen fled the area, but was later arrested and charged along with her mother, who the police believe sought to cover up the murder.MOTHER ALSO CHARGEDThe teen was charged with murder, while her mother, a 37-year-old hairdresser, was charged with conspiracy to murder and accessory after the fact.The teen was released on bail in her father's custody. However, in January, she was rearrested and brought before the Corporate Area Resident Magistrate's Court following a fight with another girl in which she bit off a piece of the girl's ear.Her bail was extended after her father told the court that he was willing to stand surety.The murder case is ongoing.Ricardo Sandcroft, an attorney-at-law who specialises in child rights and family law matters, said when the teen was brought before the courts the judge should have looked at her situation, not only for the crime but as a child needing the intervention of the Child Care and Protection Act, and invoked the involvement of the CDA.\"Without the court getting the CDA involved, it would be unfair to say they should have been supervising her actions and whereabouts because it doesn't appear that they were brought in at all,\" Sandcroft told The Gleaner.He said what needs to happen now is that the teen and her father should be brought before the court, and the father answer to her circumstance since she was placed in his custody. The teen, he said, should also be placed in state care under the Child Care and Protection Act.FATHER COULD BE IN TROUBLE\"When she was given bail, there would have been certain bail conditions under the Bail Act that her father should have adhered to,\" he said.He added that the father of her child should be charged with carnal abuse.According to retired Justice Henderson Downer, acting children's advocate, once she was placed in the custody of the father, he would have been legally responsible for her.Downer added that the state would have only got involved if she was appointed a legal aid.

In this case, we followed the procedure,\" Llewellyn insisted.\"This particular file was kept under lock and key by the members of the team that were doing the preliminary research and work for the 23-page opinion that was produced in the matter for our review,\" she added.The investigation, which is being led by a high-ranking member of the Jamaica Constabulary Force, was set in motion this week after one defence attorney wrote to Llewellyn last Friday to complain.DEFENCE CONCERNEDIn the letter, the attorney charged that extracts from the statement were reported on in a television newscast last week, even though lawyers for the three men had not been given full disclosure of all the allegations in the case.Llewellyn told The Gleaner yesterday that she immediately gave instructions for the statements to be copied and served on defence attorneys.In addition, she said, her office requested that Police Commissioner Owen Ellington launch a departmental probe \"to ascertain if there was any breach by anyone within the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) who would have had custody of the statement\".\"I viewed it (the leak) with alarm because I know that improper disclosure of statements to members of the media will be inimical to the interest of justice for all of the parties,\" she said.\"These allegations are unproven in a court of law \u0085 and, put out in that way, it can tarnish the reputation of the accused, it can act as a security threat to the witnesses for the prosecution, or at the very least, it can intimidate or render them less than enthusiastic in giving their evidence,\" Llewellyn explained.SHOULD NOT AFFECT CASEDespite the concerns, the DPP said the leak would not adversely affect the case because it would be heard by a judge alone.\"It's a judge who will be the judge of the facts of the law. And because of the high professional standard that the judge has to maintain, the judge cannot allude to anything in the media,\" she explained.In the meantime, Llewellyn declined to say whether prosecutors still want a statement from Ellington.\"It would not be prudent for me to comment on that issue at this time.

He, however, declined to elaborate on the reported vacancies at the FCJ and referred The Gleaner to Information Minister Sandrea Falconer. Attempts to contact Falconer failed.PREPARING DOCUMENTHylton, however, stressed that all was in place to launch his development programme and claimed that he would in short order be taking a document to Cabinet for its stamp of approval to push the ministry's strategies along.\"I am solid as a rock and if I tell you it is coming, then it is coming,\" Hylton said as he refused to give details on the content of the document. \"All I am prepared to say is that the document is being prepared to be taken to Cabinet.\"Describing the ministry's plans as an \"overarching concept\" for Jamaica and the hemisphere, Hylton sought to defend his seemingly protracted silence on the issue that has enraged some members of his party.\"We are just coming out of a holiday and the Cabinet was in recess,\" he said.Specific reference was made to the planned development of a section of the Caymanas lands in St Catherine into an elaborate, multifaceted free zone.\"Caymanas is alive and well. It is a critical part of our logistics strategy, but the public-private partnership has to be approved by Cabinet. That is the key to the development of the Caymanas Economic Zone,\" asserted Hylton.ANNOUNCEMENT THEN SILENCEPrior to its loss at the December 2011 polls, the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) administration instructed the FCJ to purchase 200 acres of Caymanas lands in St Catherine to erect a free zone. It is understood that a down payment of approximately $90 million of the total $900 million for the Caymanas lands was made.The JLP had announced that it was ready to start construction when it was booted from office.Hylton announced earlier this year that the project would be modified, but nothing has been heard of it since.Asked what had come of plans for the Caymanas project, Hylton would only say it was an integral part of positioning Jamaica as the global logistics hub.\"In that sense, the zone is to address industrial, commercial and services issues, and we are positioning as a critical part of what is attracting manufacturing to the services sector into the logistics \u0085 . So quite frankly, all of this is taken into a broader document to Cabinet,\" Hylton declared. \"As we speak, I am going over the document.\"\u00a0\n        \r\n                            \r\n                            &#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7200, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/419484a53cd605db", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:21.510", "title": "MoBay needs quality attractions - McNeill", "occurred_at": "2012-08-31T02:03:10", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120830/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Mark Titus, Gleaner WriterWestern Bureau:Minister of Tourism and Entertainment Wykeham McNeill says Montego Bay, St James, needs some iconic attractions if it is to rediscover the glory days when the western city was the undisputed tourism capital of the Caribbean.\"The cruise-ship industry is driven by soft adventures.

It is also challenging the judge's ruling that Section 3 of the Electric Lighting Act does not permit the minister to grant a licence on an exclusive basis.LICENCE VALIDAlthough Sykes ruled in July that the licence was invalid, he also concluded that the minister had the lawful authority to grant a licence to one operator to provide electricity, whether generation, distribution and retailing for the whole island. He then ruled that the licence granted to JPS was therefore valid.High electricity costs had led disgruntled customers to challenge the exclusive licence granted to JPS by the then minister of mining and energy in 2001.Wildman said yesterday that he would be asking the Court of Appeal to rule that the judge misconstrued the statute in holding that the minister could grant an all-island licence to the JPS under the Electric Lighting Act.\"If the Court of Appeal agrees with us, then all benefits that the JPS derived under the licence from March 2001 will have to be given back to the people of Jamaica,\" Wildman said.barbara.gayle@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7204, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e8d69123f4f7deaa", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:23.375", "title": "19-y-o nabbed by Lottery Scam Task Force", "occurred_at": "2012-08-31T02:03:10", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120830/lead/lead9.html", "data": "He has been under the microscope of the Lottery Scam Task Force for some time.

Her scores were significantly higher than the majority of college sophomores.But earning a spot in the prestigious honours society is not the only thing the Campion High School fourth-former has going for her.Tiffanie's scholastic achievement has grabbed the attention of a number of top universities in the United States, which are already lining up to offer her a spot at their respective campuses.However, since the points scored in the PSAT were just to prepare her for the big exam next year, administrators at the University of South Florida, New York University, the world-famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a host of others, have no other choice but to play wait and see.But they might not want to hold their breath as, from the sound of things, Columbia University might just be Tiffanie's school of choice to pursue undergraduate studies in the field of engineering.LOVE FOR COLUMBIAShe fell in love with Columbia while taking part in a two-week global youth conference in Washington, and was all too anxious to share her love for the university.\"I went on a tour of both New York University and Columbia University \u0085 .

He said it was at the last moment that Sandals was seeking judicial review on the grounds that \"I am not a fraud-case specialist\".In his affidavit, Stewart alleged that, as a director and treasurer, Pyne breached his fiduciary responsibility by wiring funds without permission to The Turks and Caicos Islands.The action, filed on June 30 this year, is alleging that Pyne caused the Bahamian company and another Sandals entity to make a series of seven unauthorised wire transfers to three Turks and Caicos-based companies between March 3, 2005, and October 26, 2006.Sandals Resorts International 2000, in its statement of claim, is alleging that the seven wire transfers, totalling US$1.65 million, \"were not made for any legitimate commercial or other purpose of the plaintiff's business or interests\".Sandals is seeking the return of its allegedly missing money, either through the recovery of the original funds or compensation from Pyne.However, Pyne is contending that in his capacity as managing director of Gorstew Ltd, of which Stewart and his son Adam are among the directors, he cannot recall agreeing to serve as a director of the plaintiff/claimant company, that is Sandals.Yesterday evening, The Gleaner was unable to contact representatives of Sandals for comments.Pyne and two former executives are charged in Jamaica with conspiracy to defraud the Appliance Traders Limited (ATL) Group Pension Fund and Gorstew Ltd.

They were selected to run on the party ticket although they were not official members in accordance with the constitution of the party.FATE UNCERTAINRobinson declined to state what the fate of the offending members was likely to be.\"I wouldn't want to discuss that publicly until those internal discussions have been completed,\" he said.Asked how the leadership of the PNP planned to deal with the issue, Robinson said: \"It is a fact that it has been an issue and some recommendations were made about how the general issue of group membership and status should be addressed at some length, but I can't go into a public discussion on those issues at this point.\"Controversy raged as the issue came to a head over the weekend when it was discovered that the contenders in the election for the chair of Region Four were not members of the party.Asked to name some of the active parliamentarians and party officers who were not members of a group, Robinson said: \"This is information that I would need to check, I just don't have it at my fingertip.\"Former member of parliament for Eastern St Andrew and General Secretary of the PNP, Colin Campbell, who contested the North Central Clarendon seat in the 2011 general election and lost to the Jamaica Labour Party's Pearnel Charles, could not be nominated by supporters who went to Clarendon to cast their ballots for him.Campbell's challenger, Denise Daley, who won the Eastern St Catherine seat for the PNP, was elected unopposed.But it was later discovered that the group of which she was a member was in \"abeyance\" (commonly described as paper or fictitious groups) as it had not paid the fees.Under Section 40 of the PNP Constitution, the basic unit of the party organisation shall be a group which shall consist of not less than six members and shall be approved by the constituency committee of the constituency in which the group is situated or, in default, by the Executive Committee of the Party.gary.spaulding@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7211, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bb0258526facaa59", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:27.947", "title": "Chris-Ann Chambers - Bright and talented", "occurred_at": "2012-08-29T04:06:27", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120829/lead/lead9.html", "data": "National footballer bags 8 distinctionsSixteen-year-old Wolmer's Girls' School student Chris-Ann Chambers has the talent, brains, determination and focus to realise her true potential.With the right assistance and a well-deserved scholarship, the future orthopaedic surgeon will no doubt reach the pinnacle and fulfil her dreams.An outstanding footballer and a high-achieving scholar, the teen aced her Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate examinations with eight ones, excelling in mathematics, Spanish, English language, English literature, biology, chemistry, physics and information technology.Captain of the National Under-17 women's football team and captain of the Wolmer's Girls'  School football team, she creates her own organised structure to maintain a balance and excel in both sports and academics.NOT EASY TO JUGGLE\"I have to be structured and very organised at all times, balancing my time for training and studying.

If they wish to pursue the career path subsequent to this, then the next phase, which is the full commercial pilots training, will have to be done privately.\"It has been a pretty good experience for the youngsters who have been involved.

She said it was expected that the administration of the three-week profile assessment would commence tomorrow.Approximately 35,000 students enter grade one every year and figures from the ministry show that about half of the students do poorly on the official Grade One Individual Learning Profile.nadisha.hunter@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7220, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f8f1be4dc0dcc0dd", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:32.333", "title": "Correctional officers to face the music for Christmas party", "occurred_at": "2012-08-29T04:06:27", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120829/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Dave Lindo, Gleaner WriterMANDEVILLE, Manchester:The Manchester police say two of the men arrested for Monday's murder of 27-year-old used-car dealer Michael Rochester previously had murder charges against them.One of three suspects held by the police is on bail for murder and shooting with intent charges, while another was previously charged for murder but acquitted of the crime.\"How a man who charge for murder deh pon road and come back to kill a man who is earning his honest bread?\" questioned Donna Watson, an aunt of the deceased. \"The justice system in Jamaica is not right.\"Assistant Commissioner of Police Derrick Cochrane, head of Area Three police, also shared this reasoning.\"Some of these men who do heinous crimes are able to get bail.

He reportedly met the men in Gutters, at the foot of Spur Tree Hill. The deceased's father, Guy Rochester, who was one of the last persons to speak with him, said he called Michael, who told him the men were test driving the car.ATTEMPTED TO STEAL CARIt is alleged that the men, in an attempt to steal the car from the younger Rochester, shot him and pushed him out of the vehicle on Spur Tree Hill.Through quick action by the police, one of the men, who was driving Rochester's car, was apprehended in Spur Tree as the car reportedly ran out of gas.The other two suspects were nabbed by the police while they were having a drink at a bar in Toll Gate, Clarendon.All three suspects are being questioned by the police and are expected to be charged for the murder later this week.Head of the Manchester police division, Superintendent Lascelles Taylor, warned that persons selling motor vehicles must be cautious in how they transact business.\"You have to let them (prospective buyers) meet you on your grounds,\" Taylor advised. \"You have to meet them where you are comfortable, not at a place that they set.\"Taylor added: \"If you want the assistance of the police, we can make the arrangement because, at times, these transactions may end up in the loss of lives, which happened in this case.\"We are living in a society where there are many persons with devious intent, so people have to be careful.\"rural@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7221, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b14ffaf6ff35f9c1", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:32.783", "title": "Relief flight for stranded CAL passengers in Jamaica", "occurred_at": "2012-08-29T04:06:27", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120829/lead/lead4.html", "data": "Daviot Kelly, Staff ReporterIf you've been in the St Andrew community of Southside recently, you might have noticed a farm-style area among the buildings.

The group entered it in the RISE Life Management Services' Best Community Green Space competition earlier this year.Southside won\tthe competition, which was part of the wider Inner City Youth Recycling For Income Generation Project organised by RISE. The project provided environment-awareness education, particularly how to dispose of solid waste. Five communities participated in the competition: Southside, Paradise Gardens (represented by the Leads Youth Club), Kingston Gardens, Orange Villa, and Fletcher's Land.Southside received a $50,000 prize and Michael Isaacs, treasurer of the group, said the club invested wisely, trying some of skills learned in the project.SPACE TRANSFORMEDHe also explained that the green space had been an unused, open lot going to waste.\"There was a lot of dumped-up garbage. We got involved with the environmental people and we decided that we could transform this place into a really beautiful garden,\" Isaacs said. \"There were old pipes, lots of dirty (water) running through it.\"He said the space was now \"booming with plants\".An element of the recycling project was to teach the young people how to make artwork using plastic bottles and old tyres. \"We have been using the tyres and bottles to make things like birds or baskets that you can hang your flowers in,\" explained Isaacs. \"We have received orders from a hotel in the country for some of our products.\"Isaacs noted that since winning the contest, community members have looked at the club in a new way.\"We have got some new members.

The ideal candidate should have a grasp of legal and procurement issues,\" noted Christopher Zacca, president of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica.A candid Francis Kennedy, president of the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce (JCC), argued Christie's approach was not conducive to growth and investment, and cannot be continued if the country is to move forward. He, therefore, called for all the regulations   for the contractor general to be reviewed and revised. \"To give an example of some of the issues being faced, the public conflict between the contractor general and the Contracts Commission has posed a big problem,\" Kennedy said, noting that some JCC members have singled it out as the main factor in the 80 per cent fall in the construction industry. \"We can't just have two bullheads fighting each other and the whole construction industry is held to ransom,\" he said. \"The contractor general should be facilitating growth and investment and not trying to block it, because the perception out there is that he is blocking it.\" He added: \"I know he is chasing corruption but I don't know that everything that he chases is corrupt. The office must be able to balance facilitating growth and investment, while at the same time continue to minimise corruption. Without that we can't pay our bills as a country.\" Donald Reece, former Archbishop of Kingston, on the other hand, is not opposed to Christie's style, and in fact wants \"more teeth\" to be given to the contractor general's office. This, he believes, would eliminate issues such as the   frequent public confrontations that have been know to occur between the office and the director of public prosecutions. \"As far as I'm concerned, I've always wished we had more Greg Christies in public office. Yes, maybe some of the moves he has taken in the past may not have been the most diplomatic, but then again some people don't appreciate diplomacy and therefore you probably need to have a pit bull around,\" Reece told The Gleaner. \"We need a pit bull kind of person in that office, who will hang on to something and not let go, someone who is fearless and bold.\" The archbishop noted that that type of approach is critical to minimising corruption. \"When you have corruption, democracy and the unity of the country suffer and the best expertise that you have does not come to the surface because you will then not be recognising merits, but who you know,\" he added. Keep public aware Carol Narcisse, chairperson for the Jamaica Civil Society Coalition, agrees, stating that Christie has set the bar very high for the way in which a watchdog institution should discharge its function so that the public is kept quite aware in a fearless and fair manner. \"We have had the good fortune of excellent persons in the Office of the Contractor General since its inception. What Greg Christie has brought, though, is a level of transparency, of public disclosure and accountability that we had not seen before and have now become accustomed to and therefore expect to observe in the future,\" she said. \"Therefore, there is an expectation that the level at which the office now functions will continue and be improved upon.\" In supporting Christie's approach, Pastor Everett Brown, president of the Jamaica Union Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists, strongly believes the contractor general must be dispassionate in carrying out his duties and continue to fight corruption. \"The new contractor general must be fearless, independent in his thinking and wherever corruption exists, take hold of them and refer them to the relevant authorities for them to act,\" stated Brown. The Reverend Karl Johnson, general secretary of the Jamaica Baptist Union, would prefer a candidate who brings his own style to the job. \"I don't want a Christie reincarnate, I want someone who brings who they are in the pursuit of excellence. Yes, every successor must remember that they are standing on the shoulders of those that have gone before them, but they have a responsibility to bring who they are in the execution of the job,\" Johnson declared. \"However, that person must bring to the office vigilance, watchfulness, competence, sensitiveness, boldness without necessarily being confrontational, a stick-to-itiveness to see each probe through to the end, and an openness to team work with all the key stakeholders.\" Outside of an expectation of the critical factors of transparency, collaboration and a clear outline of the process of selection and the way in which the office will operate, Brian Pengelley, president of the Jamaica Manufacturers' Association, said he would wait to see the scope that would be presented to improve the situation before commenting further. anastasia.cunningham  @gleanerjm.com \n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7222, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7e1fae241932ed28", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:33.234", "title": "MoBay meat gets healthy thumbs up... but abattoir is still badly needed", "occurred_at": "2012-08-29T04:06:27", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120829/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Alessandro Boyd, Gleaner WriterJ.

Twelve persons travelling in four vehicles were marooned early Sunday morning between Kent Village and Flat Bridge, as the Rio Cobre overflowed on to the roadway because of heavy rains associated with Tropical Storm Isaac. After several aborted attempts because of the volume of water, some were rescued hours later by emergency personnel.According to a police officer who helped with the rescue mission, the gate preventing vehicular traffic from entering the gorge from the Bog Walk end was damaged.\"It's unfortunate. Hoodlums used sledge hammer to damage the gate leading into the gorge from the Bog Walk end, and it is not usable,\" the officer told The Gleaner.But Ronald Jackson, director general of ODPEM, said they were not aware that it was damaged.\"This is news to me now that that particular gate was damaged. I was told that they closed the gate when the notice was given, but persons had actually wandered in there before it was closed,\" said Jackson.\"We will investigate to find out when that gate was damaged and also the process of the lockdown procedure for this morning (yesterday).\"He added, however, \"Even if the police did not physically close off that area, when you're going through, you would see signs of flooding in the gorge before proceeding to the point of being trapped and it is for us to exercise some personal responsibility.\"He said ODPEM has had to repair the gate by the Dam Head end twice before. Noting that persons have complained about its presence, Jackson said: \"We think it is important that something be there to prevent the public from making very bad decisions.\"Lucky to be aliveMeanwhile, Linval Hyatt, who survived two hours of trauma in the gorge yesterday, said he was lucky to be alive.\"Whoever is responsible for those gates should have them closed. They are not alert, once they knew that we were gonna get heavy rain, the gates should have been closed,\" said the 54-year-old.Hyatt said while he was aware of Tropical Storm Isaac, he did not expect the effects to be so devastating.\"They said the storm had passed, so I wasn't even thinking that it would cause so much flooding. I also expected that the gate would have been locked to prevent us from going through the gorge if the water was rising,\" he stated.\"I was on my way from Linstead to the airport to pick up my daughter coming in from New York with her mom when about 4:15, I got to Kent Village. After I left Kent Village, about half a mile down the road, the river started to come over on the road. I actually went through that part,\" Hyatt explained to The Gleaner.But he said unseen danger loomed ahead.\"I came upon another pool of water. I met a motorist coming from the other end and the driver slowed down and said that one looked dangerous, and I turned back,\" a grateful Hyatt added.However, he said while heading back to Kent Village, the situation worsened. So he called 119 for assistance. However, he was later assisted by residents of the community.\"Emergency service in Jamaica takes too long to respond. We could have died,\" he bemoaned.Reports from ODPEM indicate that the Rio Cobre, which flows through the gorge, rose 12 feet due to the rains. The gorge reopened late yesterday evening.anastasia.cunningham@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7229, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/50d104357b38d186", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:39.232", "title": "Two employees in hot seat after Caymanas $7m robbery", "occurred_at": "2012-08-28T02:35:53", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120827/lead/lead2.html", "data": "TWO CAYMANAS Track Limited (CTL) employees were being questioned by the St Catherine South police yesterday evening on what the lawmen described as \"reasonable suspicion\" of staging Saturday night's $7-million robbery at Caymanas Park racetrack.

April 30, 1978, resulting in the death of notorious gangster Dennis 'Copper' Barth of the Hot Steppers gang from east Kingston.Copper, an infamous bank robber, was killed as he ascended the stairs to rob a cashier by a policeman who recognised and shot him.Barth, who had escaped from the General Penitentiary that year, his second breakout, shot back and injured two policemen, one of whom

finest examples of political collaboration in Jamaica's 50 years of Independence.This as its administrators advance its objectives to improve the welfare of the people in a way that will redound to sustainable development.At a Gleaner Editors' Forum last week, Sharon Weber, manager of the PetroCaribe Development Fund, noted that the beneficial imprints of the fund are becoming increasingly visible as it makes its mark on education and community renewal enterprises.While the PetroCaribe Fund makes grants to finance projects aimed at improving the welfare of the poor and vulnerable, it also extends a helping hand to the Students' Loan Bureau in the forms of loan to enable more Jamaicans to access tertiary education.Weber explained that over the seven-year period, the PetroCaribe Fund has refined its modus operandi as it seeks to give assistance in grants to agencies for the betterment of Jamaica and its people.\"A system is now in place that ensures that a board is in place that is very vigilant in terms of what the resources are used for.\"Grant facilityShe noted that last year, the board established a grant facility, which seeks to provide non-reimbursable fund to assist the poorest and their communities. \"We have begun by investing in sanitation facilities in inner-city communities,\" she said. \"We have partnered with the youth programmes to provide skills training and the rehabilitation of the Coronation Market.\"Weber stressed that transparent operations are the order of the day as PetroCaribe works with the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) to ease the burden on the poor and vulnerable. \"In this regard, we are strengthening the operations of the facility itself,\" she asserted. \"We partner with JSIF and they make those interventions in the inner-city communities.\"In doing so, the PetroCaribe Fund remains above potentially divisive political partisan lines in the ongoing quest for scarce benefits. \"We don't receive request from MPs (members of parliament or NGOs (non-governmental organisations), individuals or organisations, but we have been funding a number of projects,\" asserted Weber.Among its focus is the much-needed sanitation project, aimed at eliminating pit latrines as part of the Government's Community Renewal Programme. \"We are looking to institute and refine the application procedures because many people don't know that the facility exists,\" she explained.Weber divulged that the fund is keen on helping to eradicate the use of pit latrines in public schools.By his own pronouncements, Dr Wesley Hughes, chairman of the board of the PetroCaribe Fund, is firmly of the view that it does not dabble into politics, but seeks to work and partner with other institutions.gary.spaulding@gleanerjm.com\n\n",

existence, $2.6 billion has been accrued to Jamaica in the form of rebate.Manager of the fund, Sharon Weber, made the disclosure during the forum, which was held at the company's North Street head

He said the fund is being managed in a responsible way in keeping with the tenets of the agreement. \"We are buying oil from them, with some concessionary loans (at one per cent). It is a great value to Jamaica because, with it, we do not have to have upfront all the foreign exchange required in payment for oil,\" he said.He added: \"We do have a benefit to be gained there but, very important, the people of Venezuela and Jamaica need to know that the funds are being managed in a way that when the time comes for the repayment of the loan, the money will be there.\"gary.spaulding@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7232, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/959863a8fdaf4450", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:40.640", "title": "Arnett Gdns man in custody for mother's murder", "occurred_at": "2012-08-28T02:35:53", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120827/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Nedburn Thaffe, Gleaner WriterVERONICA WIZARD had prepared her dress in the middle of last week to attend church yesterday morning, but fate proved it had a different plan for her after her life was taken in a most vicious manner allegedly by her own son on Saturday night.When residents of Hopeful Village in Arnett Gardens, St Andrew, woke up to the news of her murder yesterday morning, it was the grisly scene which greeted them that proved most shocking.\"Only the handle of the knife you could see sticking out from one of her eyes.

The long wait for her daughter's return to consciousness has not been easy, but she said she remains hopeful.For Clarke, a seeming flicker of the eyelids triggered an even bigger glimmer of hope that her daughter will see the light of day once again. \"I have to be at the hospital every single day,\" she told The Gleaner as she struggled to conceal her sorrow behind a weak smile. \"The incident took place at 7:15 a.m. and Venesha was transferred to the KPH by midday.\"Clarke said just finding the fare to travel each day from her home in Cromarty, Spanish Town, is a challenge for the mother of five, a security officer, who has been forced to take leave to tend to her daughter in the throes of deep anguish. \"It not easy, me have to find the fare every day, it just not easy with me but me have to just fight it,\" she asserted.No assistance\"I have not been getting any assistance from anyone, her relatives have helped a few times, but its really me alone.

I was released from hospital after a week, but I am still not able to go back to work as yet.\"The official report states the truck Isuzu, which is the property of the Bushy Park-based Bread and More Bakery, collided with a 1996 Nissan Sunny motor car and careened into the sidewalk, hitting the two young women.Nyiesha said her younger sister who was closer to the road took the brunt of the impact.

We asked parents in western Jamaica whether their children's education was a priority in their budgets. Here are their responses. Kenroy Pringle, driver:\"It is always a priority because your children will always have choices when they get a solid education. I make the sacrifices so that my children can get the proper education to make their lives better.\"Rosetta Dunkley, peanut vendor:\"Education is the key and you have to put out for your children. My children finish school but I have to look out for my grandchildren. Things rough right now but education is the only way for them to move forward.\"Mark Hines, sixth-form student:\"It is, because I am aiming to become a doctor. Plus, my parents are both teachers and they expect me to do well in school and have a solid education.\"Gabrielle Harris, third-year law student:\"In my family, education is seen as a vehicle for freedom of movement, speech and visions. My mother always says with an education, especially tertiary level, no one can push you around and I am more determined to finish my studies.\"Dervin 'Mixing Lab' Lee, entertainer:\"It is, because without education you won't be able to get a good job. You also need to read and write well so that you will be able to reason issues and make sensible decisions.\"Nadine Spence, businesswoman:\"Education is the only true natural human resource to elevate oneself. I tell my children that they must have a hunger and thirst for education. A sound and solid education is a sure and sustainable way to lay the foundation for a bright future.\"\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7240, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d8422d29713ac85c", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:44.252", "title": "School funding and preparations", "occurred_at": "2012-08-28T02:35:53", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120827/lead/lead93.html", "data": "Come September 3, thousands of children will stream back to the classroom for the start of the new school year.While some will face their own challenges acclimatising after the long summer break and, in some instances a new school, the schools will have their own set of challenges as they prepare to mould the young and impressionable minds.Signalling his intention to eliminate some of the anxious moments, Minister of Education, Reverend Ronald Thwaites, at a press conference on August 10, said the requisite funds were being disbursed early to school administrators to facilitate repairs and other arrangements ahead of the start of the school year.High schools, he said, had been allocated $1.38 billion for tuition and $37.4 in maintenance grants for the first tranche, while primary schools had been sent $157.77 million for the first semester.Checks with several school administrators by The Gleaner revealed that, for the most part, the schools had received their disbursements. However, the age-old problem of inadequate furnishing remains firmly in place.Principal of Swallowfield Primary and Junior High in St Andrew, A.C. Solan reported a \"lack of furniture\" for students as his \"most serious concern\".Solan, who will demit office after almost 40 years at the institution said \"the entire cohort of grades eight and nine students are without chairs, and that is certain to create some serious problems for the new administration\".While \"uncertainty surrounds the number of students placed at the school for the ASTEP classes\", Solan is confident this will be resolved once school is reopened.Adequate staff is in place and, with the exception of minor paint jobs to the interior of a few classrooms, the school infrastructure is reportedly in excellent condition.He said assessment tests for students entering grade one for readiness will be done this Wednesday, August 29 and, notwithstanding the glitches, the school is ready to face the challenges of the coming year.Funding for tertiary education As more students seek higher education every year coupled with the inevitable spike in tuition fees, the need for financing has become a growing concern.A primary source of financing, the state-run Students' Loan Bureau (SLB) has assisted thousands of students who would not have otherwise been able to access tertiary education. In the last year alone, the bureau processed 13,600 applications.According to the agency's website, their \"unmatched terms\" of \"nine per cent interest rate, long moratorium and full tuition financing\" are among the benefits students will find attractive.Director of student services and development manager at Placement and Career Services (PCS), University of the West Indies (UWI), Mona, Merritt B Henry, noted that there is a wide range of options available to students for tuition financing.These she said include scholarships, the Jamaica Values and Attitudes Programme for Tertiary Students (JAMVAT) grants, and participation in work and study programmes. She was quick to point out, though, that not everyone will qualify.Under the JAMVAT programme, students are required to \"work 200 hours within the public sector or a non-governmental organisation\". In turn, they are awarded a grant equalling one third of their tuition fee.The programme which falls under the ambit of the National Youth Service is referred to students on the UWI campus by PCS, which also acts as a clearing house.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7241, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cd2cafb1a9ffb51a", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:44.704", "title": "BACK TO SCHOOL CHECKLIST - Schools on the ball", "occurred_at": "2012-08-28T02:35:53", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120827/lead/lead94.html", "data": "Keisha Hill, Gleaner WriterAt the start of every academic year, parents and school administrators bemoan the inadequacies in the school system as they relate to overcrowding in the classroom, limited school furniture and even the student-teacher ratio. However, some schools, instead of waiting on the Ministry of Education to assist them, have taken on the initiative to help themselves.Michael Stewart, principal of the Porus High School in Manchester, said his institution is in a state of readiness. Over the summer holidays, he said, teachers and students worked to replace 200 chairs in the welding department. The collaborative work also saw some work being done on a leaking roof.\"We are about 95 per cent ready. At this, time, we do not have sufficient desk and chairs, but we have sought some assistance from Food For The Poor. We should be getting some teachers' chairs and students' desk and cupboards,\" Stewart said.However, the former Jamaica Teachers' Association president, said they are short on classroom space and regrettably have had to turn away students because they cannot accommodate them. \"The school was built to accommodate 800 students. Currently, we have 1,200 students and the classrooms are overcrowded. We have approached the ministry about improving the infrastructure. We are also looking at different stakeholders in and around the community,\" Stewart said.Parents and skilled persons in the community, he said, are willing to contribute once they are able to get the funding and the go-ahead from the ministry. \"We do not have a science lab, yet we have done well in integrated science, human and social biology and agricultural science. We can do much better if we can mobilise some stakeholders. A project such as this would cost about $5million,\" Stewart said.He also indicated following the departure of some of the 50 teachers that they have recruited replacements so everyone is in place for the September 3 start of the academic school year.Ardenne PreparesPreparations are also in full swing at Ardenne High School according to acting principal Reverend Claude Ellis. \"We have repaired well-needed desks and chairs through the Industrial Arts department. We are doing our best to prepare,\" Ellis said.Ellis said the school has reached the maximum level in its student population. \"Last year, we closed at 1,984 students. It would be ideal to have a lower class size. For this to happen it would be almost like building another block,\" Ellis said.However, he indicated that this situation would only apply for the lower school, as once students start to specialise in different subject areas in the upper school the class size gets smaller.He argues that Ardenne is doing the best it can with the available resources. \"It would make things a lot easier if we had at least two more teachers. We currently have 102 full-time teachers,\" Ellis said.Ellis said through the NCB Foundation, Ardenne Alumni and other partners they were able to get a science lab at an estimated cost of more than $30 million. To date, however, the lab is yet to be fully equipped. \"We are trying to outfit that lab ourselves,\" Ellis said.Meanwhile, Ruel Reid, principal of Jamaica College, said they are generally ready. However, they are short of about seven teachers. \"By virtue of the enrolment regulations by the Government, we are unable to get these teachers and have to employ part-time teachers,\" Reid said.Regarding class sizes, Reid said they are bursting at the seams and he is imploring the Government to build more schools to reduce the student-teacher ratio. \"Our class sizes are more than 40 and there are close to 1,900 students at JC. Officially, there are 76 teachers. We would prefer a class size ratio of 1:20, the students will learn better that way and those that need individualistic attention will be able to get this,\" Reid said.keisha.hill@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7242, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d54c0b646e63abc1", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:45.124", "title": "Operation Clean Up MoBay in effect", "occurred_at": "2012-08-28T02:35:53", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120827/lead/lead95.html", "data": "Nagra Plunkett, Assignment CoordinatorWESTERN BUREAU:Mayor of Montego Bay Glendon Harris has made good on his promise to start a campaign aimed at bringing order into the western city by reducing illegal vending, chronic traffic congestion and public-health infractions.Last week, taxi operators in and around the city had to conform to new parking regulations, which saw the creation of new spaces for operations and satellite parks, enforced by the police traffic personnel.\"I know that the new changes were to take effect for the new school year.

The system was being undermined by illegally parked taxis, absent-minded pedestrians and street vendors who commandeered the sidewalks especially along St James Street in downtown Montego Bay.The issue of creating order has been a sore point for successive administrations, which have had to weigh political fallout among the populace or the wrath of the business community.\"Come September, the St James Parish Council, the St James Police, the St James Public Health Department, the National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) and the Transport Authority will be combining efforts to deter the act of illegal vending, and put a stop to the proliferation illegal taxis; roadside cook shops and garages that continue to function outside of the regulations that guide business operations,\" read a press release from Mayor Harris.nagra.plunkett@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7243, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/32b9f349679cedfc", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:45.590", "title": "They didn't listen!", "occurred_at": "2012-08-28T02:35:53", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120826/lead/lead1.html", "data": "Gary Spaulding  \u0095  Senior Gleaner WriterSSP Lewis' advice ignored as bribery case ignitesSenior Superintendent Radcliffe Lewis has unleashed a bombshell in the corruption case against three influential Jamaicans that rocked the country last week.\"I am going to say one thing to you and nothing more. If my instructions were followed, what happened would not have happened,\" Lewis, who heads the Traffic Division of the Jamaica Constabulary Force, told The Sunday Gleaner.\"I constantly told them to take it to the court and let the court deal with it,\" he added.He was responding to queries about his role in the process which started with a routine traffic stop for a motorist who was going above the speed limit, and has now resulted in a made-for-media court drama involving a powerful businessman, an outspoken politician, and a police officer with a solid reputation and a national profile.Ironically, it was an initial allegation of bribery levelled by police sergeants Jubert Llewellyn and D. Lewis, attached to the police Traffic Division headquarters on Elletson Road, which started the ball rolling.According to the reports, the events emerged from the issuing of a traffic ticket to businessman Bruce Bicknell by Llewelyn for speeding on the morning of Easter Monday, April 9, 2012, along Florizel Glasspole Boulevard.Bicknell, who was accused of driving at 80km/h on a stretch that facilitated 50km/h, was charged with bribery after he allegedly offered two $1,000 notes to Llewellyn inside an envelope containing the papers for the motor vehicle.UNDER PRESSURESince news of the incident broke last Monday, Llewellyn has reportedly come under pressure, sparking concerns about the spirits of other members of the police Traffic Division.But Lewis told The Sunday Gleaner that the morale of the men and women under his command remains high.\"This incident doesn't faze us. It simply has not affected our morale,\" he said.Questioned on whether he had been asked to submit a statement to investigators, Lewis declared: \"I am not going to answer you.\"When asked if he has been summoned to appear as a witness in the case, Lewis also shied away.\"I am declining to comment on that.\"The Sunday Gleaner also sought answers from Lewis as to whether he was aware of the sequence of events as they unfolded since April 9, when the drama started to play out.SPOKE WITH LLEWELLYN\"When I heard it was bribery, I sat him (Llewellyn) down and asked him how it went, and then dictated the entry that is to be made and he wrote it and signed it \u0085 . I was an operating experienced officer.\"A Sunday Gleaner probe found that nearly a week later, Llewellyn was at the Elletson Road Sports Complex when he received a call from Lewis, who instructed him to attend his office.Llewellyn was reportedly informed that the Anti-Corruption Branch was requesting statements from the two sergeants who were on duty, Llewellyn and D. Lewis.The Sunday Gleaner learnt that Lewis subsequently instructed Llewellyn to attend the traffic headquarters to be escorted to the Anti-Corruption Branch by one Inspector McKenzie.At the branch, Llewellyn reportedly met and spoke with Assistant Commissioner of Police Justin Felice and Senior Superintendent Selvin Hay and outlined the sequence of events to them, after which statements were registered starting the probe which is now before the court for a determination.Member of parliament for Western Portland, Daryl Vaz; head of the police Community and Safety Branch, Senior Superintendent James Forbes; and Bicknell, a noted business personality, were last week hauled before the Half-Way Tree Criminal Court on charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice and breaches of the Corruption Prevention Act.The three were charged following an investigation by the police Anti-Corruption Branch based on a ruling by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.Vaz, Forbes and Bicknell are to return to court on September 5.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7244, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4ede5cc093946941", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:46.116", "title": "Birthing poverty: Is two still better than too many?", "occurred_at": "2012-08-28T02:35:53", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120826/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Erica Virtue, Senior Gleaner WriterReality is hitting home hard. Too many women are having too many children they cannot afford, for too many men who will not stay.This is one of the lessons that emerged from the disruption of the lives of squatters in downtown Kingston recently. A large number of children - as many as seven with one mother and different fathers - were among scores of people flushed to a Duke Street sidewalk with all their belongings after they were evicted from a property which they illegally occupied for years.Published reproduction figures show 2.12 children per female in Jamaica. However, anecdotal evidence would suggest that many women, especially in poor inner-city communities, are mothers to multiple children with multiple absent fathers.More than three decades after the National Family Planning Board (NFPB) launched its 'Two is Better Than Too Many' campaign to promote responsible parenting, some Jamaican women continue to give birth to children they cannot support.Statistics provided by the World Bank quoting the United Nations Population Division show that the Jamaican adolescent fertility rate - the number of births per 1,000 women age 15-19 - is 73. TEENAGE MOTHERSIn one case in Manchester, a teenager became a mother at 15, had seven children by the time she was 30, and increased that number to 11 before her 40th birthday.At 56, she is now a great-great-grandmother.In another case, also in Manchester, the young girl became a mother at age 13 and had her second child by the time she was 15 years old.She became a grandmother by the time she was 25, and is now a great-great-grandmother at 52 years old.Similar stories from several communities across the island have led to questions about the effectiveness of the age-old family-planning message.But the NFPB says it still provides contraceptive pills for women at a cost of $25 per pack, and condoms at $5 each in an effort to reduce the cost of birth control.Contraceptive injections are also available at public health clinics at a reduced cost, but still the women have several children they cannot support financially or emotionally.Last week, psychologist, lecturer and host of the weekly radio programme 'Mind Doctor', Christopher Charles, argued that where there is no employment, skills or education, and a warped value system, the children produced are likely to graduate into a criminal industry.\"It's a common phenomenon among the poor across societies. So the so-called white trash in the USA manifests the same phenomenon.\"Once the woman is uneducated, unskilled, unemployed, it does not mean she does not need a man for emotional needs. The partner they can get, because of the level they are on, will almost certainly cannot provide much more,\" said Charles.A clinical psychologist, Charles offered counselling services in the Harlem area of the United States before his recent return to Jamaica.He said a significant percentage of his clientele were among America's poorest.NOT MUCH BARGAINING POWERThe lack of economic independence, according to Charles, does not allow the woman much room to take a position, such as demanding that the man use a condom.The end product of unprotected sex is not only the risk of unplanned pregnancies, but also life-threatening sexually transmitted infections, Charles suggested.Charles argued that in many of these cases, there is no relationship to sustain the unprotected sex, which leaves the woman with another child, another mouth to feed, and a step deeper into poverty.Childbirth becomes a vicious cycle because the uneducated, unemployed woman will need a man to financially support her offspring.\"But the more children she has, it's less likely that the man will stay. All that an additional child does is cause less food for the others, and that is another step deeper into poverty,\" Charles pointed out.Lobbyist Betty-Ann Blaine called the eviction of the women and their children from the Duke Street property they were squatting on \"wicked\", but did not address the sexual irresponsibility of the women.Blaine, in a later address, said she did not encourage persons to have children that they could not support, as \"unless you get a good education, \u0085 you will never break the inter-generational cycle of poverty in Jamaica\".She stressed the importance of stable families to the development of the country.\u00a0\n        \n                            \n                            \n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7245, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/20b94de6f38e6c84", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:48.001", "title": "How the drama unfolded", "occurred_at": "2012-08-26T03:37:33", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120826/lead/lead3.html", "data": "MONDAY, April 9, 2012 Sergeants Jubert Llewellyn and D.

Donovan Stanberry, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, has once again raised many eyebrows and set tongues wagging since the arrival of his spanking new 2012 Mercedes-Benz.Stanberry, who is on vacation leave, told The Sunday Gleaner that the order for the vehicle was made last September under the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) administration, but the vehicle was not delivered until January 5, this year.According to Stanberry, the deal makes economic sense, as the price of the vehicle was below the limit allowed for ministers and permanent secretaries, which was increased from US$25,000 (J$2.1 million) to US$35,000 (J$3.04 million) in April of last year.\"The practicality and economics of it show that there is no need for me to be driving a six-cylinder SUV around town, when a car can do the job,\" said Stanberry.\"I cannot provide what the exact value is at this time, but based on my entitlement, I purchased the most efficient vehicle within the value range allowed.\"I also considered reliability, longevity and the additional attraction of three years' free servicing, and, in fact, it is cheaper than the top-range SUVs around,\" said Stanberry.His new wheels is a C-Class Mercedes-Benz with an elegance package and a current price tag of $6.3 million at Silver Star Motors Limited, the local authorised dealer. However, Stanberry would have benefited from duty concessions and other allowances, which would see the cost lowered.But that has not satisfied JLP spokesman on information, Arthur Williams, who has challenged the purchase.\"As far as I am aware, at any given time, there is a fleet of vehicles at the ministry that the permanent secretary could make use of, instead of making such a purchase at this time,\" said Williams, former minister of state in the Ministry of Finance.When challenged with the claim that the vehicle was ordered when his party formed the Government, Williams argued that it is the permanent secretary in each ministry who decides on how the money is spent.\"If as a minister I need a vehicle, I would have to ask the permanent secretary. If he said no then it is no.

As a matter of fact, they were very alert and one of the policemen on duty came out to ask us if we were OK because we had parked in the courtyard for a little while.That policeman told our news team that the gates are closed at 1 a.m. for security reasons but police personnel are always available and the phones are manned.The next stop at 12:20 a.m. was the Vineyard Town Police Station.

But a policeman on duty explained that the door is locked with the key in the wee hours of the morning.Those needing the assistance of the cops would just need to knock and the door would be opened, the cop explained. \"As a police, you must take steps to protect yourself and the Government's property,\" the policeman said.He added: \"You can't just leave the door open (because) man will run in on you,\" said the policeman who is stationed in an area metres from where one of his colleagues was murdered just over a decade ago.The cop said four police personnel usually work the night shift at the Mountain View Police Station that also has a lock-up.At 12:55 a.m. our news team was at the Gold Street Police Station in the section of Central Kingston known as Southside.That station is heavily fortified with bars and grilles on the entrance and windows.To gain entry, our news team had to push back a heavy-duty metal grille that runs on wheels. The cops were not asleep. \"We up. A different place this. Think you can shut your eye? When you go home you sleep. A ghetto this,\" said one of the policemen on duty.His words painted a picture: policing in Jamaica is not a cakewalk but working the night shift is even more dangerous.His colleague chimed in: \"Most of the stations you have to close them because they don't have enough personnel for security purposes.\"There were four police officers on duty at this station as well. But the Gold Street Station was the only one that our news team visited that had a 10-man contingent of soldiers.\"This is Southside; right in the belly of it. That's why soldiers dung here day and night,\" said the first policeman who recounted a gun battle between rival gangs that pinned his colleagues inside the station for four hours.Our next stop was the Denham Town Police Station on Spanish Town Road in western Kingston.We didn't stay long.

Last Friday, after a nearly eight hour delay, the airline took to the skies, destination Georgetown, Guyana, with a mock demonstration of what customers can expect from the entity, once it is up and running. The Sunday Gleaner team was among a group of persons invited for the demonstration process. Just as with any other airline, we went through all the requirements necessary to board an aircraft. It was smooth sailing as we went through check-in and immigration, however, because of the rigorous checks and balances of the Jamaica Civil Aviation Authority (JCAA), the airline's crew did not receive clearance to do its checks and boarding of the invited passengers until after 5 p.m. The Boeing 757 aircraft came under heavy scrutiny and was inspected with a fine-tooth comb to ensure that the required support systems and services were in place. Afterwards, we briefly observed the captain and his crew and in-flight services, including the smartly dressed air hostesses, preparing for what was a memorable flight. The aircraft is expected to comfortably seat 12 first-class and 186 economy-class passengers. Licence  to operateAccording to Chief Operating Officer Lloyd Tai, following a satisfactory demonstration, this airline will be given its licence  to operate.\"We are required to conduct a normal flight for the process. This includes check-in and immigration as with a normal flight. We went through a comprehensive audit to ensure airworthiness but we are happy that we have been able to get the demo going despite the logistical issues,\" said Tai.As the plane taxied down the runway to lift off, cheers of joy echoed from the crew and passengers. It was a relief to those who had waited for close to a year to see this phase of the process begin. \"This is the first time that an airline in Jamaica has had to go through the full certification process. Air Jamaica was here before the new regulation so all they had to do was show conformity. We have to show that we have met all the standards of the local and international regulators from the beginning,\" said Tai. According to Tai, after the aircraft returns to Jamaica, they will be debriefed on the issues, if any.  Interestingly, the process does not stop there as, upon the issuance of the licence, the airline has to prove 'economic authority', which is to show financial viability. \"They (JCAA) have to ensure that we have the means to continue operating at a safe standard. This information we have already submitted.\" He said the operators of the airline will also have to start applying for the routes that they want to service.The airline plans to offer full service on the chosen routes between Jamaica, Guyana, Toronto and New York, which Tai believes will appeal to the diaspora concentrated in these areas.He said, Fly Jamaica Airways will likely start with a three-on-three flight schedule to each destination, with one day downtime for maintenance.Fly Jamaica was set to begin operations in August, however, Tai said with the remaining processes it is likely to take another month before the airline officially takes to the skies.keisha.hill@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7255, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0f68a3c1986122aa", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:52.617", "title": "Brace for rain - Met Service urges Jamaicans not to take Tropical Storm Isaac lightly", "occurred_at": "2012-08-26T03:37:33", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120825/lead/lead1.html", "data": "THE METEOROLOGICAL Service has warned Jamaicans not to take lightly the tropical storm watch in effect for the island.The centre of Tropical Storm Isaac is expected to pass northeast of Jamaica today as it makes its way to Cuba and the public is being advised to make the necessary preparations in the event that the country is adversely impacted by tropical-storm conditions.The forecast is that heavy rainfall will affect the entire island, but mainly the northeastern parishes.Heavy rainfallAccording to the Met Service, outbreaks of thunderstorms and heavy rainfall, reaching near 300 millimetres (12 inches) over the next 48 hours, could result in flash flooding and landslides.

Murray also cultivates a wide range of crops on his 70-acre property in Maidstone, where he dabbles in freshwater and tropical fish.Meanwhile, president of the Jamaica Agricultural Society (JAS), Senator Norman Grant, told The Gleaner that the Manchester duo will be kept busy over the next 12 months, with the JAS using them as ambassadors to attract youngsters and investors to the sector. He explained that a number of farm tours will be conducted at both farms to highlight the best practices which put them at the top of their game.FUTURE FILLED WITH HARD WORKFor Powell, who honed most of his farming skills as a member of the Jamaica 4-H club, hard work has been a way of life for some time and already he is looking to increase production and improve productivity, encouraged by the estimated 20,000 pounds of yam he projects to harvest in his first full year of reaping the tuber. Add to that the 25 to 30,000 pounds of cabbage for the year and things are really looking up for the repeat young champion farmer, who has a clear plan about what he needs to do and the wishlist to go with it.\"Definitely a greenhouse - that would do me wonders. I have a box-body truck which I used to do everything but some areas of the farm are hard to access,\" he disclosed. \"So I need a four-wheel drive vehicle to get around more and something to make me go faster when I am spraying, like a mist blower. Those are three major things I'm looking forward to right now.\"Long-term planning is key to Powell's success as he admitted to \"working with the seasons\", especially as it relates to the availability of water.Said he: \"I study the season, because there are certain crops that can withstand the dry spell, ... and then I incorporate mulching and I harvest rainwater to get around that (dry spells) in this area.\"Having supplied yams and sweet potatoes to exporters, while providing a consistent supply of good quality produce for the local market, Nicholas Powell is a shining example of what can be accomplished by youth in agriculture.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7262, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b991da0469b1cf65", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:44:55.842", "title": "Math crisis", "occurred_at": "2012-08-26T03:37:33", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120825/lead/lead1.html", "data": "THE METEOROLOGICAL Service has warned Jamaicans not to take lightly the tropical storm watch in effect for the island.The centre of Tropical Storm Isaac is expected to pass northeast of Jamaica today as it makes its way to Cuba and the public is being advised to make the necessary preparations in the event that the country is adversely impacted by tropical-storm conditions.The forecast is that heavy rainfall will affect the entire island, but mainly the northeastern parishes.Heavy rainfallAccording to the Met Service, outbreaks of thunderstorms and heavy rainfall, reaching near 300 millimetres (12 inches) over the next 48 hours, could result in flash flooding and landslides.

At the time the claim was made by residents in 2010, Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) Colonel Rocky Meade told journalists that he was unaware of the use of such force.\"I am not sure what persons refer to when they talk about bombs, so I can't speak to that either,\" Meade had said.He added that the soldiers were being very careful to protect the rights of persons in the west Kingston operation.However, a cable obtained under the United States Freedom of Information Act confirmed that mortars were used by the JDF.After the revelation, the JDF admitted to the use of mortars, but said they were used as a diversionary tactic.\"Mortar rounds were fired into open areas as part of a diversion. At no time were persons or buildings targeted. This diversionary tactic created confusion and disorientation among the entrenched gunmen, and allowed the JDF to use bulldozers to breach the barricades and enter the community,\" a release stated.At the end of the operation, which lasted from May 24-25, 73 persons were killed. An investigation has been launched by Public Defender Earl Witter. However, after two years, the report has not been made public.Coke, the target of the operation, is currently serving 23 years in a US prison after pleading guilty to gun and racketeering charges. \n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7273, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b701294e045ec01c", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:01.797", "title": "Economy to remain flat this fiscal year", "occurred_at": "2012-08-24T06:15:40", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120824/lead/lead9.html", "data": "Bank of Jamaica Governor Brian Wynter has indicated that, with persistent weak domestic demand and a less than vibrant global economy, growth in the real sector remained flat through the June 2012 quarter and is likely to stay depressed for the remaining three quarters of the fiscal year.Wynter was addressing yesterday's quarterly press briefing at the Bank of Jamaica in downtown Kingston.The BOJ governor however said there were encouraging signs as there has been an increase in the growth of private credit from commercial banks, a situation he believes augurs well for improved growth prospects in the medium term.Monetary policiesHe indicated that in the near term, monetary policies could be tempered by adverse weather conditions, weak demand domestically and internationally, as well as other factors in the international market.\"We are currently in the height of the hurricane season and adverse weather could be disruptive to both inflation and growth,\" the governor said.\"On the other hand, if external demand is weaker than projected, crude oil prices could be lower, which would be positive for our inflation forecast.

The teachers are not adequately prepared to teach at the CSEC level. The bulk of the teachers across the system are trained at the teachers' college level to teach at the diploma level.\"The teacher factor is mandatory. They need more content.

Assistant Force Chaplain Reverend Courtney Faulknor noted that this was the clinic's second year.\"We focused mainly on children last year. But parents, too, are very much affected,\" he said.According to Faulknor, the focus of the seminar was on the spirit, mind \"and anything else that will help the children to perform at their best\".The clinic is open to both police and civilian staff of the aforementioned branches. Faulknor noted that because of their jobs, members of the security forces are not always able to devote as much time as they would like to their children.\"It's especially tough for those children transitioning from primary and prep schools to high schools,\" he noted. This year's event was themed 'I Am A Promise' and had guest presentations from New Nation Coalition founder Betty Ann Blaine and clinical psychologist Dr Sandra McDermott.McDermott hosted a discussion with parents only, while the approximately 40 children were placed into groups of four, each one led by a student of the Caribbean Graduate School of Theology's counselling psychology programme.Blaine said she believed the police can do more to quash the stigma that they are the public's enemy.\"If all of our police officers and all of our soldiers, especially the men ... decide to mentor one young man, each one mentor one, can you imagine the kind of impact we would have?\" she asked.\"A mother can raise a son, but it takes a man to raise a man. So we are calling to the men, step up to the plate and mentor our boys.\"Adopt a mentorship programmeBlaine suggested that the branch could adopt a mentorship programme.\"The boys need coaching, they need guidance. They need men to teach them to be good men, courteous men, productive men, men who will respect and honour women, men who will be leaders of integrity.\"The children's group sessions included talks on issues such as peer pressure and indiscipline. Participants were also given financial advice by the Jamaica Special Co-operative Credit Union.\"Apart from being stimulated in the mind, we believe it takes money for schooling,\" said Faulknor. He said ISCF members from as far as central Jamaica made the trip, while most of the Mobile Reserve personnel were based in the Corporate Area, though they may have family in other parishes. Asked whether the clinic could be expanded, Faulknor was hopeful.\"It is more for this area, but I would imagine that there would be interest when the positives spill over.\"\u00a0\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7277, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eaa1c6084e057f17", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:04.218", "title": "Vaz, Forbes to give up duties pending case", "occurred_at": "2012-08-24T06:15:40", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120823/lead/lead4.html", "data": "Gary Spaulding, Senior Gleaner WriterA hush seemed to have descended on the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) and the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) as two of their stalwarts began a fight for their freedom in a high-profile bribery and corruption case.But in the silence at JLP headquarters on Belmont Road in New Kingston, eyebrows have been raised at how a legislator from the highest court of the land - the nation's Parliament - could become embroiled in such controversy.Daryl Vaz, the outspoken JLP spokesman on information and communication technology (ICT) and digital society development, and the well-known Senior Superintendent of Police James Forbes appear to have been shunted out of their public duties, pending the cases against them.Forbes' situation seems to be more straightforward, even though senior officers who ventured out to the Corporate Area Resident Magistrate's Court, in a show of support for their beleaguered colleague, were tight-lipped on his fate.A highly placed source, who appealed for anonymity, explained that the standard procedure in the JCF is that the relevant officer would be sent on leave pending resolution of the matter.The Gleaner worked feverishly to make contact with JLP Leader Andrew Holness in the aftermath of yesterday's court hearing, but the calls went unanswered. Holness' assistant, Arthur Williams, also failed to respond to calls.Late in the day, however, the persistent quest for answers was greeted with a terse response from a senior party member.\"The matter is in court,\" he said.Devoid of detailsA statement dispatched to the media, by the Office of the Leader of the Opposition, was also devoid of details.\"Mr Vaz has informed the party of charges brought against him and he has advised of the actions he will take to clear his name and defend his innocence,\" it read.The statement added: \"The party takes note of the circumstances and the charges. The party is satisfied that Mr Vaz has taken the necessary steps to pursue justice within the legal system.\"However, The Gleaner has been informed that Vaz was instructed by Holness during a meeting yesterday that he should retreat from the public glare.Vaz obliged, dispatching his own statement to the media.\"As a result of my facing the court today, I have indicated to the leadership of the Jamaica Labour Party that I will take leave of absence, with immediate effect, from my sole position in the party, that of shadow minister on ICT and digital society development,\" he said in his statement, which was issued hours before the party's.Vaz added: \"I have taken this principled position, as it is not only the correct course of action, but also I would like to distance and minimise the effect on my beloved party as this matter is strictly of a personal nature.\"Vaz, who first won the Western Portland seat in 2007, later retained it in a by-election, and was again victorious in 2011, had a word for his constituents.\"I would like to assure my constituents that I will continue to serve West Portland with my 110 per cent commitment, as I am confident of being vindicated once again in the many challenges I have faced in my public life.\" gary.spaulding@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7278, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1c1741b0062b9362", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:04.645", "title": "Phillips firm on IMF wrap-up", "occurred_at": "2012-08-24T06:15:40", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120823/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Steven Jackson, Gleaner WriterMinister of Finance and the Public Service Dr Peter Phillips yesterday reaffirmed his commitment to wrap up negotiations for a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement by September.The IMF - a funding organisation comprised of 188 nations - should then make a determination by December, Phillips told media and stakeholders during a Gleaner Editors' Forum held yesterday at the newspaper's North Street, central Kingston, head office.\"We will have, what I expect to be, concluded negotiations by the 25th of September when the IMF team comes here. So there is no delay in the programme discussions,\" said Phillips.He later added: \"The team is coming September and I expect to go to the board before the end of the calendar year.\"Opposition concernedEarlier this month, the Opposition raised concerns over the apparent delay in the pending IMF deal.The previous Jamaica Labour Party administration in 2010 entered a 27-month, US$1.27-billion standby agreement with the IMF. Within a year, however, the agreement was falling apart based on missed and adjusted fiscal and tax-reform targets.The economy recorded flat growth over the first six months of 2012, which severely trails leading regional economies in Latin America. Phillips stressed that reducing the island's debt as a per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), currently at some 130 per cent, remains critical to allowing the country increased gross prospects. The Government proposes by March 2016, under its Fiscal Responsibility Framework, to balance the Budget and reduce the public-sector wage bill to nine per cent of GDP and the public debt to 100 per cent of GDP.Phillips, however, stated that the Government would continue to meet its J$1.7 trillion debt obligations and avoid default.\"It would have a tremendous impact on the financial health of your domestic financial system.

My involvement in this matter is of a personal nature, and as such, I would never compromise myself or any public officer.\"He said his enquiries into the matter were made out of concern and done openly, with no ill intent.Speaking with The Gleaner last night, Vaz said: \"My statement stands as my response to the incident. However, when I come back in another life, the only thing I will change is my name, Daryl. But I will keep everything else including my values.\"For his part, Bicknell, whose family owns and operates the steel and heavy equipment firm Tank-Weld, has also reportedly denied the allegations in a statement to two police sergeants who are involved in the investigations.Information reaching The Gleaner revealed that a Sergent Llewellyn was on duty along the Sir Florizel Glasspole Boulevard in east Kingston when he witnessed a speeding white SUV being driven by Bicknell.It is alleged that the SUV was heading towards the Norman Manley International Airport at 80 kilometres per hour in a 50kph zone on the morning of Easter Monday, April 9 this year. The Gleaner understands that Llewellyn ordered the vehicle to stop and issued Bicknell with a speeding ticket.Allegations are that Bicknell produced an envelope containing the motor vehicle documents, along with $2,000. Llewellyn reportedly brought the contents of the envelope to Bicknell's attention, after which the businessman offered the money to him.The sergeant allegedly refused the money then alerted a senior police officer that he suspected Bicknell was trying to bribe him.It is understood that Bicknell was taken to the Elletson Road Police Station. Forbes and other senior officers were allegedly brought to bear on the issue.Bicknell was granted bail, although it was a public holiday.Sources say later that day, the sergeant also received a call from a male who identified himself as Daryl Vaz. However, the police officer told Vaz he was not the arresting officer in the matter but was the complainant in the bribery case.Further appealsLater that day, Vaz reportedly visited Llewellyn at the Elletson Road station and made further appeals to the sergeant to drop the bribery case against Bicknell, but the policeman allegedly rebuffed the politician's advances.A day later, Vaz reportedly told the sergeant that Bicknell was not in tip-top health and would not be able to cope with a prison sentence. He also cautioned that Bicknell would lose his US visa and jeopardise his business reputation.It is understood that Vaz claimed Police Commissioner Owen Ellington had given him his blessing to \"speak\" with the sergeant.As pressure allegedly mounted on Llewellyn to drop the case, he reportedly sought guidance from former Police Commissioner Lucius Thomas, who suggested that mediation be pursued.The Gleaner understands that on April 13, Forbes agreed to facilitate the mediation and later divulged to the sergeant that the matter was \"taken care of\". Llewellyn reportedly met Forbes at his office in the presence of Bicknell and another business associate.It is alleged that the sergeant refused the two men's business cards that were offered to him. He reportedly did the same when Vaz contacted him after the mediation to express his gratitude before saying he \"still has something\" for him. Vaz sought to assure the police officer that Bicknell would not be the source of the supposed gift.Sometime later Llewellyn was summoned by traffic chief Senior Superintendent Radcliffe Lewis at Elletson Road, informing him that Assistant Commissioner Justice Felice, a British police officer seconded to work with the Jamaican police and who led the anti-corruption unit, needed a statement on the issue, which led to the DPP's probe into the matter.As at July 2012, the Anti-Corruption Branch has charged 32 police personnel and 37 civilians for corruption breaches.gary.spaulding@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7285, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3ab4ee41696e53fe", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:12.641", "title": "Teachers reject latest wage offer", "occurred_at": "2012-08-22T01:43:10", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120822/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Barrington Flemming, Gleaner WriterWESTERN BUREAU:The island's teachers have flatly rejected the Government's latest offer on the outstanding 2010 to 2012 salaries and conditions of service claim served in 2009.President of the Jamaica Teachers' Association (JTA) Clayton Hall told The Gleaner at the end of yesterday's session of the JTA's 48th Annual Conference at the Ritz Carlton Resort and Spa that the association received a partial response from Minister without Portfolio in the Ministry of Finance Horace Dalley on Monday, which is woefully inadequate.\"The teachers are highly dissatisfied with the offer at this time and we are seeking to have a holistic review done or seeking that the Ministry of Finance provides us with a response to the items of claim.

We were expecting to see some movement on even one major item which is the special teachers allowance which would see teachers across the island getting at least some reprieve from the prevailing economic conditions,\" Hall said.\"There is little within this offer which speaks to buoying or assisting the teacher in coping with the increasing cost in the standard of living.\"He indicated, however, that while the response was not what was envisaged, there was some movement on the motor vehicle loan for travelling officers to equate it with their colleagues in the public sector.Hall also said agreement has been reached regarding what he said was the phased removal of pit latrines from schools, and there was an undertaking to provide security fencing for schools, beginning with the five most needed within this financial year.The JTA's head also said that the Government had indicated that it had received more than 2,000 applications from unemployed teachers in response to the Emergency Employment Programme (temporary employment) and that the process of selection would commence shortly and the teachers placed in September.School disruptionsHall also sought to brush aside claims that there could be some disruption to the school year come September, based on the Government's response to the JTA's claim.\"Teachers are the last persons to do any disruption within the education system because we are cognisant of the importance of what we do. So, therefore, we are not considering any disruption to the education system, but we are seeking the benevolence of our employers to recognise that we operate under trying economic times and we would like to see at least some reprieve - some breathing space in ensuring that we too can survive.\"The JTA is also awaiting word on the 2010 to 2014 contract, the claim for which has already been submitted to the finance ministry.The teachers are also still owed for the 2007 and 2008 pay period.barrington.flemming@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7286, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/79489f51fa7efd87", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:13.241", "title": "Vaz accused of offering gifts to cop", "occurred_at": "2012-08-22T01:43:10", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120822/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Parliamentarian Daryl Vaz allegedly made a promise of metal bars to the police sergeant who moved to slap bribery charges on businessman Bruce Bicknell.The Gleaner understands that Sergeant Jubert Llewellyn claims he was at the Police Transport and Repair Division, where he is stationed, on April 12, three days after he accosted Bicknell along the Sir Florizel Glasspole Highway, when he received a call that a visitor was at the front of the premises to see him.He said a white SUV was parked outside with Vaz seated inside.

A billboard also followed. Chad is described by his parents as a down-to-earth, jovial person, who leaves a lasting impression on everyone he meets, so lasting that Sheldon Gibson, a friend of the local film producer, thought he was perfect for the audition.His father, Christopher James, told The Gleaner of Chad's selection.\"The production crew was at the stadium pool for the shoot, and about 20 to 25 children were selected for the audition. It was a big secret. No one knew what the audition was for. We only knew they wanted them to jump from a dive platform,\" James said. He further stated that Chad best depicted the essence of the commercial - greatness is not in one specific person, it is in anyone who tries to find it.\"At first, he really hesitated. After a few encouraging words, he thought about it, then he did it,\" the proud father added. He also revealed that this is the same approach Chad takes towards life. Whenever there is a challenge, he often thinks about it before undertaking it.James said he knew that Chad was a special child from infancy, and as soon as he could, he began to engage in various sporting activities and was able to perform better than other children his age.\"He is a top football player, does track and field, and comes first for his house on sports day. He plays golf and table tennis, and I have to try really hard to beat him,\" James said.

He is a likeable child, considerate, a gentle soul. The only time you will see him exerting himself is when he is doing sports,\" his father said, smiling.His mother, Gillian James, said that they both play an integral role in Chad's life, supporting him in all that he does, instilling good values, and going to his football matches and tournaments. \"We teach him the right morals and values and \u0085 to be a leader instead of a follower,\" said Gillian.Chad recently attended the Barcelona football camp in Florida, having first done so at age six.

There was no pressure when it was near to my exams,\" noted Willis.The support structure provided by his father, Michael Willis, a senior teacher at the Montego Bay High School; and his wife Winsome, the acting vice-principal at Harrison Memorial High School, was also identified by Brian as key factors in keeping him grounded.\"Having my parents playing an active role in my life throughout the years was important and played a critical role in my academic success,\" the youngster said. \"I am motivated by my parents' accomplishment but I want to better my best effort so a lot of it is intrinsic as well.\"Loving environmentIn his CSEC passes, Willis had distinctions in technical drawing, human and social biology, social studies, biology, information technology, mathematics, English language, physics and principles of accounts.

UK media coverage of Jamaica House at O2 generated millions of viewers and readers worldwide.\"In addition to the coverage received by the country, McNeill announced a number of deals sealed between Virgin Holidays and TUI, two major European tour operators.He said meetings with head of Virgin Holidays, Amanda Wills and TUI's managing director for the UK and Ireland, David Burling resulted in \"Virgin Holidays confirming another flight from Gatwick to Montego Bay which represents 25,000 new seats for next year. TUI finalised an extra fortnightly flight for the winter to Montego Bay and weekly flights in the summer from Gatwick, Manchester and Birmingham,\" said the tourism minister.Large diaspora populationHe said this would add 11,000 new seats. Of note is that two of these three gateways have a large diaspora population.Boasting other successes of Jamaica House, McNeill said this included the facilitation of face-to-face contact and interaction with some 18,000 visitors to the venue, and a peak in interest in Jamaica during the Games.\"This interest was of such a magnitude that Skyscanner, a leading flight aggregating website, reported a 53 per cent increase in enquiries about travel to Jamaica during the period of the O2 promotions,\" the minister said.More than 300 travel agents and tour operators were also brought in during Jamaica House promotions.In terms of plans for the future McNeill stressed that \"we will continue to leverage the outstanding performance of our athletes at the London Olympics in promoting the destination. Already plans are in place for our advertisement featuring Usain Bolt to be used in an on-line campaign for the UK market. Interest in Jamaica continues to grow globally and we have invited 1,500 travel agents to visit Jamaica in five rotations starting September 6.\"janet.silvera@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7306, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b05df1785b09cd70", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:29.575", "title": "Residents angered by removal of Melaine mural", "occurred_at": "2012-08-21T05:31:51", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120821/lead/lead8.html", "data": "Livern Barrett, Gleaner WriterIt stands out like a sore thumb as you travel along Maxfield Avenue in St Andrew.The picture of former world and Olympic champion Melaine Walker, which has been a source of pride for the community where she was born and raised, has been removed from the wall where it was mounted for years.The circumstances under which it was removed are clouded in controversy, but the end result is that it has left some residents angry.One resident, speaking on condition of anonymity, charged that the picture was angrily removed by Melaine's mother, Jenefer Wilson, months ago following a dispute with persons who had set up a stall in front of it.\"She and the girl dem inna tings (have a dispute) and she get mad an' tear it dung seh a fi har daughter she can do wha she want wid it,\" the resident claimed.\"She flap the community.

She is the mother of Taiwo McKenzie, one of two so-called good Samaritans who were murdered in November 2007. McKenzie's body and that of his girlfriend, Jhanel Whyte, were found in bushes at Mount Salus in Red Hills, St Andrew, with their throats slashed.Fifty-six-year-old Graham, who was employed to the Legal Aid Clinic in Kingston and was a lecturer at both the University of Technology (UTech) and the Norman Manley Law School at the   University of the West Indies, as well as a United Nations representative, was found dead at the Caymanas Polo Club, off Mandela Highway, yesterday morning. In a statement yesterday, the police said the body of Graham, who was also from a Gordon Town address, was found about 6:50 a.m. The police said a missing person report had been filed over the weekend after several attempts by family members to contact her failed. The gruesome find was too much for some family and friends to bear as they struggled to come to terms with the attorney's death. \"She had gone to visit a friend about 7 or 8 last night,\" said her brother, Edgar Graham. \"She was spoken to and the next thing I hear this morning is that they found her body. Even her house was broken into, but I am not sure if they were waiting on her there.\" Made no sense One resident with whom The Gleaner spoke said Graham was a quiet person and it made no sense that someone would want to kill her. \"She was so humble. She came here to live about two years ago and since then we have never heard her in any argument with anyone,\" the resident recalled. \"She live good with everyone. You could see her walking in the mornings with her earphones in her ears. When I hear this morning I cried and from that I can't move. Not even cook I can't go cook, it is so touching,\" another person said. Ian Wilkinson, president of the Jamaican Bar Association, said he was saddened by the incident. Wilkinson said Graham was a hardworking member of society who contributed positively to legal aid services in Jamaica. \"Ms Graham worked in the legal aid department for many years, offering service to all those who accessed the legal system and for her to die in such a manner is not only ironic but very sad and we are extremely moved by this. This is the last thing I was expecting to hear,\" he said. \"We wish to express condolences to her family on behalf of the bar association and all those who have worked closely with her and we are hoping that the perpetrators will be brought to justice,\" he added. Former student shocked Rochelle Russell, a former student at the UTech who Graham had taught, was still in shock when she spoke with The Gleaner yesterday. \"I can't understand why somebody would take her life in such a manner. She was very humble and had a good relationship with her students. Trust me I still can't believe,\" Russell said. Graham's death comes two months after the men accused in her son's murder were convicted. In November 2007, McKenzie and his girlfriend were travelling together in a motor vehicle and met in an accident with Andr\u00e9 Ennis and another man who were travelling along Border Avenue in St Andrew on a motorcycle. The men were taken by the couple to the University Hospital of the West Indies where they were treated and released. The following day, it is alleged, arrangements were made for the couple to take medical supplies to the injured men at an apartment in Havendale. However, the couple was never seen alive again after making the trip. Convicted of the double murder last June are Ennis, a 24-year-old labourer of Havendale, St Andrew, and 24-year-old Passmore Millings, also called Shane Brown, of Gregory Park in St Catherine. They were said to have participated in the abduction and subsequent brutal murders of the two. \n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7309, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/337efbd916681b7b", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:30.996", "title": "Local institutions get 'Powerwise'", "occurred_at": "2012-08-21T05:31:51", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120820/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Edmond Campbell, Senior Staff ReporterWITH THE frequent spike in the cost of oil on the international market and its crushing impact on the productive sector - and by extension consumers in developing states, like Jamaica - one local company believes the age-old formula of applying energy conservation measures combined with contemporary technology can, in fact, change the current conversation about \"whose light bill is highest, to how much I am saving\". Debate on the cost of electricity in Jamaica is arguably one of the most emotive issues which cut across class barriers and provoke intense discussions almost daily on talk shows and current affairs programmes.Effective Energy Solutions, known by an increasing number of Jamaicans as mypoweraudit.com, calls itself a game changer as it seeks to work with its clients and ultimately the majority of Jamaicans to achieve a minimum 20 per cent reduction in their light bills.Operating 'outside the box'Paul Lopez, director of Effective Energy Solutions, said the company was operating 'outside the box' and has expanded its focus from home-based clients to the targeting of schools where students are trained to be energy monitors.Sherol Dixon-Lewis, principal of Alvernia Preparatory School on Tom Redcam Drive in St Andrew, describes her introduction to Effective Energy Solutions as \"the best kept secret\".The company first carried out an audit at the institution to determine areas where electricity was being wasted.Following the audit and installation of energy-saving devices the school started to see savings in its energy use. Within the first month the institution started to see its electricity bill nosedive.\"We have seen where our electricity bill has reduced significantly. Coming from a bill of more than $100,000 per month, the institution, after introducing energy saving measures, has seen its energy charges cut to a little less than $80,000,\" Dixon-Lewis told The Gleaner.\"I would call that improvement of a significant nature. It's money in our pocket instead of in JPS's (Jamaica Public Service Company's) coffers,\" she added.Alvernia Preparatory now boasts the enviable record of being the first school to be certified as a 'powerwise institution'.Dixon-Lewis said the meters at the school are read every day and posted online by appointed power administrators or student power monitors. The data from the meter reading is posted on mypoweraudit.com and this allows the company to interact online with the school or by way of text messages to give a daily update on the amount of energy used during the month or each day over the period of the billing cycle.\"We don't see ourselves as a company that sells gadgets, we see ourselves as a company that offers solutions,\" Lopez asserted.\"Our website is the brain behind the entire operation because, apart from giving you the gadget to shut off your fridges at nights - it's programmed to shut off your fridge at nights and bring it back on in the morning - we have our website that allows you to monitor and see exactly what is happening.\"He added: \"I am very happy that the students have taken on to it and are able to understand the concept behind the meter reading,\" said Lopez. However, he wants to take it a step further by inviting corporate Jamaica to partner with the energy solutions company so that the programme can be introduced in schools across the country.\"Monitoring can reduce your bill by 20 per cent. If you see some of these schools' light bills then you will understand what 20 per cent can do.\"Not so complexFor the students from grades four to six at Alvernia Preparatory, who recently participated in a workshop at the school which was staged by Effective Energy Solutions, learning to read JPS meters was not as complex as it appeared at first.Applying mathematical skills of '10s and ones' the bright students quickly grasped the concept and demonstrated their knowledge when they were quizzed using different scenarios.Newly appointed power monitor Christojay Barnett said as an energy monitor she has to ensure that all the fans and lights that are not in use are turned off.Speaking with The Gleaner, Christojay outlined her duties and those of her fellow power monitors at school.\"The meter must be read every day before lunch time. It has to be updated on the website every day. I feel happy and overjoyed to really help my school to cut down on the light bill. We are energy monitors every day at school and at home. So no matter where we are we must really show that we are monitors.\"Serious jobAn equally enthusiastic Gabriel Francis said her new role as power monitor gives her \"a good opportunity to do something else at school\".Taking her job seriously she said: \"If one of the flood lights is on and it is not needed I should report it to my power administrator, and a couple hours later I should check if it is still on, and if it is still on, I should approach my power administrator and ask why is it still on and it has to be for a good reason.\"Lopez and his brother Raymond, who spearheaded the 'Powerwise' initiative in schools, are of the view that children can make a significant difference in the drive to conserve on energy. \"When we start like this, 15 years from now we shouldn't have a problem when it comes on to effectively saving on energy,\" he said.\"When you start cutting the fat from the bone it doesn't affect your lifestyle, because that is waste. When you remove waste it doesn't affect your lifestyle. When you turn off a fan when it is not in use it doesn't affect your lifestyle and it reduces your bill.\"edmond.campbell@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7310, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8414dcdcbb17d57c", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:31.452", "title": "Thwaites urges JTA to remain steadfast", "occurred_at": "2012-08-21T05:31:51", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120820/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Karen Sudu, Gleaner WriterOld Harbour, St CatherineEducation Minister Ronald Thwaites is urging the new administration of the Jamaica Teachers' Association (JTA) to remain steadfast in its journey to provide quality education for the nation's children, in order to build a better Jamaica.\"Hold on to the cross that takes us forward to the transformation of our nation,\" Thwaites urged yesterday while addressing the JTA's 48th Annual Conference Church Service, at the Church of the Holy Trinity, Old Harbour in St Catherine.

We can't afford to put a fence in all schools and we shouldn't have to afford that,\" he argued.\"Communities must own the schools, we must strive after partnership between neighbourhoods, the principals and the officials of the schools as the schools are sanctuaries for the community and must be treated as such,\" he added.Police Force readyHead of the Safe Schools Initiative, Superintendent James Forbes, has reassured the country that the Police Force is ready for the new school year.Forbes said training sessions have been taking place across the island, to prepare staff members for the days ahead.\"A number of training programmes have been implemented in order to get our staff members prepared for the new school year in terms of their own preparedness and security issues.

The central water, drainage, and sewerage project has been on the books for more than 16 years, and was first brought to the fore by then Member of Parliament for East Portland, Sam Lawrence, who demitted office in 1998.Timothee Delebaree, acting country manager of Vinci Construction Grands Projets, gave the assurance that the work will be carried out in a professional manner, and that great care would be taken not to inconvenience residents too much during the time of construction. However, one of the drawbacks to the project as outlined by the minister is pipelines, which have been in use for more than 40 years, which will have to be replaced so as to ensure that the project can be a success.The minister added that he has every confidence that the project will be completed on time, and within the budget specified.rural@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7316, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2a7c2e08c5add99d", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:34.179", "title": "Government to disclose Olympic benefits today", "occurred_at": "2012-08-21T05:31:51", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120820/lead/lead9.html", "data": "The Government has promised to update the nation today on the returns derived from promotional activities undertaken around the London Olympic Games.Tourism Minister Dr Wykeham McNeill, Industry, Investment and Commerce Minister Anthony Hylton  and Agriculture Minister Roger Clarke are expected to outline the details during a Jamaica House press conference.Jamaica won 12 medals - four gold, four silver and four bronze - in London, for its highest medal haul ever at the Olympic Games.Going into the Games, the Government had undertaken a number of promotional activities aimed at increasing the popularity of Brand Jamaica.Since the Games, there have been calls from various sectors for initiatives that will tap into the enormous attention Jamaica garnered in London.Lack of marketing strategyLast week Opposition spokesman on tourism and travel service development Edmund Bartlett said he was concerned about the lack of a discernible marketing strategy by the Government in capturing \"this very rare opportunity to tangibly extract benefits for Jamaica's tourism industry and the wider economy\".In a release, Bartlett also questioned the seriousness of McNeill's and state minister for tourism and entertainment Damion Crawford's visits to London \"at the expense of taxpayers\".\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7317, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4e82f5ffa634e753", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:34.623", "title": "Cable theft hampers LIME in St Catherine", "occurred_at": "2012-08-21T05:31:51", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120820/lead/lead91.html", "data": "Telecommunications firm LIME declared yesterday that the latest incident of theft of some of its transmission cables in Hellshire Heights, St Catherine, has resulted in service restoration costs of $3.5 million. \"This brings to more than $9 million for such repairs for the company in that parish alone in less than two months,\" LIME said in a release that noted Government's consideration of a lifting of the ban on the scrap metal trade.\"The theft of this type of cable has been linked with the illicit trade in copper scrap in the past,\" LIME added.More than 700m of cableThe telecoms firm said the incident, which affected Hellshire Heights, Johnson Hill and its environs in the parish, resulted in loss of approximately 500 metres of 600-pair cable and a further 230 metres of 200-pair cable impacting voice and BlackBerry service of about 300 customers last week.\"The theft of our cables continues to affect us in many ways.

This was not so as the island was producing much of the red peas it consumed.Today, Jamaica imports more than 90 per cent of the staple as fewer farmers dare to challenge the 'lucrative' import market.The low price of the imported red peas has driven many local farmers out of the once-thriving industry, leaving the market open for traders who import the product from around the world.This has not escaped the attention of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Jamaica Agricultural Society (JAS), who are moving to change the trend.\"We have delivered 100 quarts of red peas to farmers in Portland and, over the next two months, the same quantity will be given to selected farmers in the other parishes to stem the demand for importation,\" said Senator Norman Grant, newly-installed JAS president.\"They will be required to pledge back some to the JAS National Peas Bank Programme, which will be launched in October,\" added Grant.Import billAccording to Grant, while he could not readily provide the exact cost of Jamaica's red peas import bill; the figure was \"just too much\".The JAS boss said the red peas being used in the national project is of a superior quality to the imported product and the initiative will also help to generate well-needed employment.\"We will also be targeting the importers that bring in the peas and have them buy from the JAS Central Marketing Programme that we want to have up and running within the next six months.\"With a food import bill at some $900 million, the Ministry of Agriculture is also trying to reduce the flow of red peas into Jamaica.\"The level of the country's red peas farmers is probably down to around three to four per cent now, or probably less, in the entire country,\" said Ian Hayles, state minister in the Ministry of Agriculture.\"We are going to be doing some things to fix that, because the level of custom duties that is placed on red peas importation cannot work,\" Hayles told The Sunday Gleaner.Hayles also expressed concerns about the safety of the red peas that is being shipped into the island for consumption.\"In terms of food security, it is something that we have to look at ... some months ago, we had a big problem with the importation of red peas where it was discovered that rats were in a couple of containers of red peas that came here.\"Hayles was also critical of the importers.\"There are business people in Jamaica who feel that the best way to grow the agricultural sector is to import.

I prefer if you get it from the ministry,\" he added.The national security ministry did not respond to questions our news team sent last Friday.However, Sunday Gleaner sources have revealed that the DCS and the ministry are caught between a rock and a hard place.According to the well-placed source, one of the plans on the table is moving the male inmates from the South Camp Adult Correctional Centre, a maximum-security prison, and placing them at the other two already overcrowded maximum-security facilities, Tower Street and St Catherine.The source said this is the more dangerous of the two leading options being considered, as overcrowding poses clear and present dangers and difficult challenges.The other option is the construction of a new prison. But, the cash-strapped Government might be less inclined to go this route.In September 2011, Dr St Aubyn Bartlett, then state minister in the national security ministry under the Jamaica Labour Party government, made it clear that the Government could not afford to build a new prison.At that time, Bartlett told The Gleaner that the construction of new correctional facilities would have to be driven by private individuals as the Government is strapped for cash.He also told our news team that the national security ministry was searching for lands to relocate the St Catherine-based Fort Augusta Adult Correctional Centre because the Port Authority of Jamaica was seeking to expand and redevelop the Port of Kingston.The lands of Jamaica's sole female prison, as well as surrounding parcels, were sold to the Port Authority close to a decade ago as part of redevelopment plans for the Port of Kingston.Transport Minister Dr Omar Davies recently announced that the Port Authority has received a proposal from China Harbour Engineering Company Limited (CHEC) expressing an interest in providing private investment to develop a new container terminal on lands already owned by the authority as well as lands to be created by dredging at Fort Augusta.According to Davies, the Cabinet has given approval for the Port Authority to proceed with the implementation of a non-binding memorandum of understanding with CHEC for the development of a container terminal at Fort Augusta.This is expected to use most of the 50 acres (125 hectares which now house the prison and surrounding lands.tyrone.reid@gleanerjm.com\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7323, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/253bef5e4d80c5eb", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:37.424", "title": "When the law is a shackle", "occurred_at": "2012-08-21T05:31:51", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120819/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Daraine Luton,\u00a0 Senior Staff ReporterMore concerns over procurement rulesCalls for changes to the procurement rules for government transactions have increased as Jamaica stumbles in its attempt to take advantage of developments in critical sectors such as energy.\"I am personally convinced that the rules and the fear of just being off the line .... have driven inaction for the simplest thing,\" adviser to the prime minister and head of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) steering committee Dr Carlton Davis told a Gleaner Editors' Forum last week.\"If it takes high policy to say this is what we have to do for the national interest, say it to the country and go to the Parliament. We have to recognise that this is a business world, this is not a world in which people have time to sit down and solve a thing.\" Davis asserted.Like Davis, former chairman of the LNG steering committee and president of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica Christopher Zacca is convinced Jamaica will not be able to make significant advancement unless the procurement rules are revamped.He pointed to the decision by the LNG team not to accept a bid for the supply of gas from the international well-established firm Marabuni because the bid arrived a few minutes after the 5 p.m. closing time.\"For them to come in a few minutes late and because of the procurement rules (the bid is not accepted) ... I think that is unacceptable,\" said Zacca, as he also addressed the Editors' Forum. much criticismThe Office of the Contractor General (OCG), now led by Greg Christie, is tasked with policing the procurement rules and Christie has faced much criticism for some of his actions.But Zacca says the problem is not with the OCG but the procurement guidelines.\"Greg Christie is only enforcing the rules that have been given to him by the Parliament of Jamaica,\" said Zacca.Davis readily agrees. \"The rules have been carried out as they have been laid out, and they have been carried out with enthusiasm.\"He argued that the energy sector requires special treatment and should be subject to different rules as it relates to procurement.Davis noted that as part of Jamaica's push to introduce LNG, one of the things that the Government speculated on is whether it should have a preferred bidder for the infrastructure or negotiate with the two entities which had submitted technically sound bids.\"We sought legal advice and we were told to play the ball straight, take no risk because that's our procurement rule.\"According to Davis, Jamaica needs to move now on energy or miss opportunities, which could set the country back for many years.\"This energy thing is of such moment that it cannot be a slave so completely to methodology and rules that you get straight As for methodology and rules and straight Bs for effectiveness and economics,\" said Davis.Davis and Zacca's call for changes to the procurement guidelines has the full support of Minister of Transport, Works and Housing Dr Omar Davies.\"The whole procurement process, it is lengthy, and does not necessarily guarantee the equity and the transparency,\" Davies told The Sunday Gleaner.That came as no surprise because Davies is the Government's point man in a dispute with the OCG over three projects and the establishment of an independent oversight panel (IOP) to monitor them.heart of a disputeThe procurement guidelines are at the heart of a dispute involving Minister of Transport, Works and Housing Dr Omar Davies and the OCG.In April, Davies announced in Parliament that the Cabinet had established the IOP to advise it on the implementation of three megaprojects, two of which had not received the blessing of Christie.At that time, Davies said the administration, \"will not allow the OCG to be a stumbling block in the engagement of private entities as the State moves to take advantage of investment opportunities\".Christie immediately responded, arguing that the establishment of the IOP was an attempt to usurp the OCG.\"The OCG takes strong offence and exception to any suggestion that is made that by virtue of the discharge of its lawful mandates, under the Contractor General Act, as is prescribed by the Parliament of Jamaica, and which it is sworn to do, that it is impeding economic growth and development in Jamaica,\" said Christie.The projects are the north-south Highway 2000 link, Gordon Cay container transhipment hub, and the Fort Augusta container terminal.According to Davies, were it not for the intervention of the OCG last year, the Chinese investors would have long advanced work on the north-south link of Highway 2000.\"I have just reviewed the files which reported on former Minister Audley Shaw's visit to Beijing, and a year ago, they were at a stage where had we proceeded, the Mount Rosser bypass would now be complete,\" Davies said last month.That did not phase Christie, who has consistently argued that the OCG was set up to ensure that government contracts and licences are void of irregularity, impropriety and corruption.\"The OCG is of the view that economic development must be pursued in a sustainable and responsible manner, and within an appropriate system of institutionalised and independent checks and balances which will ensure that the Jamaican taxpayer can be guaranteed value for money and that all government commercial transactions will withstand the highest levels of scrutiny and probity.\"The parties are now before the courts for a determination on whether the OCG can dictate members of the IOP to report to it.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7324, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4fd2f68ba2139d54", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:38.744", "title": "LNG

the price quotations of the liquefied gas and within another couple of weeks we will determine whether the whole thing makes senses and if it makes sense how fast we move on it,\" said Davis.Under the original plan supported by successive administrations, LNG would be added to the country's fuel mix, replacing oil to sharply reduce the country's energy bill while lowering the price of electricity to consumers.The plan was made on the assumption that the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) would construct a new 360 megawatts power plant in Old Harbour Bay, St Catherine, by 2014.The JPS has indicated that the plant should be up and running by 2014, but recent concerns from potential financial partners have left a cloud around that project.The company is also yet to say if it will proceed with the building of the new plant if the Government fails to deliver LNG.price discussionLast Thursday, the Government's technical team reviewed the proposals for the supply of the gas and this week, the LNG steering committee will meet to discuss the price of the gas before making a recommendation to the Cabinet.\"We have the quotations for the infrastructure, we have the quotations for the price of the LNG ... there are financial security issues ... all these put together will give us a pretty good idea of where we are, then we will meet (and make a decision),\" Davis told the Editors' Forum.\"Issues as to whether we are going to abandon that path wholly or partially will be determined. The real question is whether the JPS will find the price that (the LNG) comes out to at a sufficient comfort level ... to give the public a price of electricity that is much lower than they currently pay,\" added Davis.If LNG can be sourced at an acceptable price, the JPS could reduce the fuel cost to its customers by approximately 40 per cent.According to Davis, \"Circumstances will dictate where we go from here. As I said, in just a matter of days we will know what sort of game is on, if a game is on in a certain direction.\"However, despite the price concerns which could derail the project, Davis did not comment on the Government's decision to select Samsung as its preferred bidder to do the LNG infrastructure when its offer was higher than the bid entered by EXMAR.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7325, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/40ac6c77beab02ec", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:39.270", "title": "Book prices jump!", "occurred_at": "2012-08-19T06:13:10", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120819/lead/lead4.html", "data": "Parents shopping for textbooks for back-to-school can expect to pay as much as 10 per cent more than last year, in some cases.The increase comes despite the Government's decision to roll back the general consumption tax it had imposed on textbooks during the 2012-2013 Budget Debate.Just under two weeks ago, Education Minister Ronald Thwaites had told journalists that parents should see a considerable reduction in the money needed to provide the required books for their children, with the ministry's publication of an approved list of texts.But checks by The Sunday Gleaner showed that while a few books had the price unchanged from last year, some reflected increases of up to 10 per cent, with the vast majority showing upwards price movement of between five and seven per cent.One parent also pointed to a pack of writing books which had seen a 20 per cent price increase over last year.However, Carlong Publishers, one of the major players in the book market, told The Sunday Gleaner that any increase in the price of its books would be moderate.\"Our secondary-level and primary-level supplementary books have been increased by between five and seven per cent for the 2012-2013 school year when compared to 2011-2012,\" said Dorothy Noel, publishing manager at Carlong.\"However, we have a major primary-level supplementary series, Integrated Studies, and these prices have been held by us,\" said Noel.She said the prices of some other supplementary primary-level books have also been held steady by Carlong.complained bitterlyLast week, several shoppers in downtown Kingston complained bitterly about the price of the books.\"Every year dem raise up di ting dem, that's why single mothers like me ago always find tings hard,\" said Irvine McKenzie, a 53-year-old woman who was buying books.Ms Mac, as she referred to herself, complained about the rise in the price of a pack of six writing books.She told The Sunday Gleaner that last year the pack of books cost $500; now it is costing her $600. That is, an increase of 20 per cent.\"This $100 increase may seem little for average Jamaicans, but for a person (like me) who works $6,000 weekly and has to take care of four boys, it is a lot,\" McKenzie explained.\"The books dem really expensive, but me can't do much bout dat.

Suffering the agonising pangs of hunger so many many nights, Thomas said sometimes he and his siblings were so hungry, they felt they were going to die. They depended on the mercies of an aunt who sold soup in the town, who would feed them with the leftover she had.At age 14, while at Spanish Town Secondary School, he had an encounter with someone special who would lead him to fulfil his destiny.\"She was a godsend who changed my life. She made me believe that anything was possible, that I could do anything I set my mind to. I now understood that where I came from and what I went through did not determine my future,\" he shared with The Gleaner.\"That was the most important lesson I learnt in my life: Christ plus education equalled success.\"HIS CALLINGThe inspiration of that Christian woman heavily influenced his decision to pursue the path of pastorship. He also felt it was a calling on his life.Now trained and qualified in the professions of teaching and theology, Thomas has combined the two towards his objective of saving at-risk youth.\"I feel I am perfectly positioned to be that change agent to point the youth in the right direction. My life experience in the inner city as a poor youth, rising from that to now being both a pastor and a principal, I am an example that there is hope. There is something better out there and they can achieve whatever they set their minds to. All they need is that someone to believe in them and steer them on that right path and I am eager to pass on those values,\" he stated.Through the work he has been doing as an educator for more than 20 years, and a pastor for the past two years, Thomas said he is heartened to see the positive impact he is having, witnessing to youth who once thought their lives were lost to now being lit up with hopeful possibilities.CHANGE AGENT\"I am truly humbled by the fact that God has given me the opportunity to be a change agent and I will continue to do His will until I leave this Earth,\" said the married father of three.The 40-year-old embarked on his first principal assignment this month at Homestead. He now leads a staff of nine teachers and three volunteers to work with the student population of 227 to move the school from a level two to a level five.He has set out a strategised, comprehensive plan of action, which includes partnering with other schools in the community, working closely with parents and residents of the community, and instituting a number of initiatives at the school - all with the aim of elevating the level of education in the wider community.He intends to achieve his objectives by moving out from within the walls of both the church and the school and take his mission into the creases and corners of the communities.\"With God's help, all things are possible, so I am just craving the support of the community and Jamaica, that we may succeed in having a positive impact on Homestead,\" he closed.anastasia.cunningham@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7786, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/49b0938ae3162733", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:56.580", "title": "They're all for education", "occurred_at": "2012-09-19T04:26:04", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120918/lead/lead1.html", "data": "Gary Spaulding, Senior Gleaner WriterMPs spend on more than handoutsDocuments obtained from the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) Programme Management Committee have revealed that, since January, the majority of parliamentarians have made education a primary focus of their assistance to constituents.Of all 63 members of the current Parliament, first-time parliamentarian for Western Kingston, the Jamaica Labour Party's (JLP) Desmond McKenzie has been listed as spending the largest amount from the CDF - some $7.4 million - on educational programmes.Data from the CDF unit have indicated that, up to September 14, McKenzie's education disbursement has amounted to around $2.5 million more than the $5.4 million that has been spent by another first-time parliamentarian, Damion Crawford. Crawford is the People's National Party (PNP) member of parliament (MP) for East Rural St Andrew. McKenzie is followed by Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller, the MP for South West St Andrew, with $7 million. Dr Fenton Ferguson, the PNP MP for East St Thomas, rounds off the top three with a $6-million spend on education.Crawford, who finishes in fourth place, has been placed under the public glare since finding himself in hot water with members of his constituency. The embattled MP has claimed he was being attacked for his determination to pump funds from his CDF into educational-assistance projects.Angered by suggestions in the public domain that Crawford is the only parliamentarian focusing on education, some MPs have scoffed at any perception of martyrdom that has been ascribed to their dreadlocked colleague. They have sought answers from the CDF unit's records on education disbursements since the start of the year.Same spend as crawfordThe data highlight parliamentarians who have dug into their allocations, which total $15 million per year, to come up with almost the same amount as Crawford for educational assistance to their constituents since January.These include MP for Western St Andrew, Anthony Hylton; Eastern Westmoreland MP, Luther Buchanan; MP for East Central St Andrew, Dr Peter Phillips; Dr Morais Guy, Central St Mary; and Central St Andrew MP Karl Samuda.Edmund Bartlett, of East Central St James; Olivia Grange from Central St Catherine; Dr Andrew Wheatley (South Central St Catherine); Colin Fagan (South East St Catherine); Pearnel Charles (North Central Clarendon) and Peter Bunting (Central Manchester) are also major contributors to education, spending $4 million each.Most of the other parliamentarians have spent more than half their approved allocation - in the region of $3 million - on education. Some MPs are however arguing that they have spent far more on education than is reflected in the CDF data.Julian Robinson, who represents South East St Andrew and was listed as spending $3.1 million on education, is claiming he has spent more than twice what is reflected in the data from the CDF unit.Robinson said a significant amount spent on specific programmes was not included in the data, and subsequently released to the media an amended list he said was from the CDF unit and reports his spend on education at $6.1 million.\"The fund does not include other educational items such as summer education initiatives by some MPs, which increases the allocations to much more than the amount of money reflected,\" he said.\"I hosted a summer reading camp where more than 1,000 students from eight communities throughout the constituency participated. I have also provided assistance for students in meeting their education-related fees at primary, high and tertiary levels.\"However, when The Gleaner questioned Robinson further about the discrepancies between the figures included in the document he provided and that provided directly to The Gleaner by the CDF unit, he admitted that the funds identified in his document included projects to be brought before Parliament's CDF committee today.Another first-time parliamentarian, the MP for North West Manchester, Mikael Phillips, also claimed he was spending far more on education than what was reported in the CDF unit's data.\"Isn't educational support when I assist two children - twins - being supported by a single mother who has to find between $300 and $400 daily for fares to travel from a rural community to school?\" Phillips asked rhetorically. \"How are the children eating, how can a family of four provide for this child outside of what Damion is doing?\"On the original CDF unit document, Phillips was listed as spending $2.5 million on education while, on the document provided by Robinson, he was listed as spending $5 million on education.gary.spaulding@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7787, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/847464be19c409f6", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:57.057", "title": "Hewitt was fearless investigator", "occurred_at": "2012-09-19T04:26:04", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120918/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Glenroy Sinclair, Assignment CoordinatorHe celebrated his 69th birthday last Thursday, then buried one of his uncles in Clarendon on Saturday. Less than 24 hours later, his relatives, some of whom had travelled from overseas, were plunged into deeper mourning when the news began spreading like 'wildfire' that retired Senior Superintendent of Police Anthony 'Tony' Hewitt's life was cut short by a gunman's bullet.His death has pushed the number of persons murdered since January to more than 800. According to police records, between January 1 and September 15 of this year, there were 795 reported cases of homicide. In comparison, it was 776 for the corresponding period last year.Hewitt, who grew up in the Johns Hall district of Clarendon, had been the darling of hundreds of Corporate Area residents since he joined the police force on August 21, 1963. During his tenure, he spent most of his time dismantling gangs and apprehending their members. Ironically, he is believed to have been killed by members of a notorious gang in St Andrew North, a terrain he policed for more than a decade.\"He was well loved,\" commented Calvin Benjamin, a retired senior superintendent, who was with him during a deadly gun battle with criminals along Deanery Road, Kingston 3, on November 6, 1981. Two policemen were killed in that incident.Early in his working life, Hewitt left the postal service and got enrolled in the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF). Among his first assignments were duties at the Patrol Division. His hard work and dedication later arrested the attention of the top brass of what was then the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).The fearless investigator then climbed up the ranks of the CID, which was later renamed the Criminal Investigation Bureau. As his investigative skills improved, so too did his popularity, which enhanced his capability in gathering first-class information, which was later processed into intelligence.Apart from his local training in the JCF, he was also trained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States.\"He served this country well,\" said retired Assistant Commissioner Garnet Daley, who was his immediate supervisor at one stage while at the elite squad, the Special Anti-Crime Task Force.glenroy.sinclair@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7788, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d738927528af96c0", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:59.243", "title": "Double life sentences for men convicted in 'Good Samaritans' killing", "occurred_at": "2012-09-19T04:26:04", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120918/lead/lead6.html", "data": "Barbara Gayle,  Justice CoordinatorThe two men who were convicted in June of the murder of the couple dubbed the 'Good Samaritans' were yesterday given two life sentences and cannot apply for parole until they each have served 50 years.Andrew Ennis, 24, construction worker and mechanic of 44 Highland Close, St Andrew, and Passmore Millings, also called Shane Brown, music writer and carpenter of Gregory Park, St Catherine, were sentenced when they appeared in the Home Circuit Court.Justice Lloyd Hibbert, in passing sentence, said he agreed with Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Paula Llewellyn that the crimes they committed were heinous.They were each sentenced to life imprisonment and 50 years before parole for the murder of 23-year-old Jhannel Whyte, and life imprisonment and 40 years before parole for the murder of Whyte's boyfriend, 24-year-old Taiwo McKenzie. The sentences will run concurrently so the men cannot apply for parole until after 50 years.Whyte and McKenzie were found with their throats slashed in Mount Salus, near Smokey Vale, St Andrew, on November 9, 2007.In handing down the sentences, Hibbert said the murders were extremely distressing. The judge said that if people on King Street, downtown Kingston, were canvassed for the appropriate sentence, he was sure 90 per cent would say the men should get the death penalty.He said although the case could attract the death penalty, he had to look at the law and apply it along the line of the famous Jamaican case of Pratt and Morgan and see if the court would act in vain in passing such a sentence.STRIKE A BALANCEHibbert said he would also have to consider, if the sentence of death was passed, if it would be carried out within five years given all the appellate processes. The judge said when he looked into all the circumstances which included the social enquiry report, the community reports and the antecedent reports of the men, he had to strike a balance and forgo the death penalty.The Privy Council had recommended in the Pratt and Morgan case that if the death sentence was not carried out within five years then the sentence should be commuted to life.The Crown, which was represented by the DPP and prosecutors Claudette Thompson and Kerri-Ann Kemble, led evidence that McKenzie and Whyte were kidnapped on November 7, 2007, when they went to Havendale to deliver medical supplies to George Cooper, who was hit off a motorcycle by a car driven by McKenzie.Cooper, who was the main witness for the Crown, testified that when the couple came with the medical supplies they were tied up, gagged and led into bushes by the two accused.Cooper pleaded guilty to conspiracy to kidnap and rob the couple and is now serving an eight-year prison sentence.Ennis was represented by CJ Mitchell, while Millings was represented by the father-son team of Tom and Christian Tavares-Finson.barbara.gayle@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7326, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/52979c2c423dc5b9", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:39.782", "title": "Back-to-school gifts", "occurred_at": "2012-08-19T06:13:10", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120819/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Approximately 60 students were awarded scholarships while more than 100 received back-to-school books at an annual book fair that was held yesterday at the Hope Gospel Assembly church in Kingston.The Reverend Dr Peter Garth, pastor of the church, said the project targets children in depressed communities to ensure that they have access to education, as that is the only avenue through which they can uplift themselves.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7327, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2f03bc4eebbc57ef", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:40.221", "title": "LNG delay understandable", "occurred_at": "2012-08-19T06:13:10", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120819/lead/lead6.html", "data": "The former head of the Government's liquefied natural gas (LNG) steering committee Chris Zacca, is downplaying the impact of the extended delay in the introduction of this product to the country's fuel mix.Zacca, who now heads the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica, told a recent Gleaner Editors' Forum that criticisms about the State's slow movement on this critical matter are unfounded.\"I have made the point consistently that if you had all the LNG in the world today, you would have to burn it in your stoves at home because there is nowhere to burn it, so you have to combine your schedule to their (the Jamaica Public Service Company's) schedule to build a new power plant,\" said Zacca.Without that generating plant there is no project, so the delays are not an issue,\" added Zacca.For years the price of LNG was a fraction of the price of oil, but with increased demand for natural gas in recent years the price has started to increase, with a recent Morgan Stanley research document showing the price at December 2011 more than double what it was in December 2010.LNG was priced at approximately 50 per cent of oil in 2010.\"Our problem with fuel in this country has resulted ... from us trying to make the best be the enemy of good.

However, the practice has continued and several parents last week complained to The Sunday Gleaner.\"My son received a grade one in maths that he sat privately while in fourth form, and now that he is going into fifth form, the school is insisting that he must do the exam again. That is madness,\" one irate parent declared.\"The schools want their numbers to look good, so they want the children to do the exam with them, although the child already has a grade one,\" said another parentLast Thursday, McLean said it was fiscally imprudent of the schools to ask the Government to pay for subjects in grade 11 that the students already received a grade one or two for prior to reaching that grade level.MINISTRY'S POSITIONAccording to McLean, when the matter came to light two years ago, the ministry's position was that the schools should work out a programme that would facilitate those students.McLean encouraged parents who are facing this situation to contact the education ministry. \"If they bring it to our attention, we will intervene by dialoguing with the school,\" said McLean.The acting permanent secretary also pointed out that some schools have made allowances, but insist that the students go to the classes even if they don't sit the exams in May or June.In addition, McLean told our news team that some schools insist that the students retake the exams because it \"affects their overall pass rate\". This, she argued, was an incorrect approach because it is not student-centred.\"They are the ones that are important - not the statistics or averages, but each individual child,\" said McLean.The highly sought-after St Andrew High School for Girls is one of the secondary institutions that insist that all their students sit the CSEC in grade 11, and it is not backing down.According to Sharon Reid, principal of the school and president of the Jamaica Association of Principals of Secondary Schools, that position will not be abandoned as it is clearly documented in the school's handbook that is given to each student at grade seven.\"From the student joins the institution, it is clearly stated in the school's handbook that when you reach grade 10, it is a two-year course.\"\"We tell you that we are preparing you for that and not accommodating persons doing it before that,\" she added.Reid said the school's philosophy of education is not centred on passing exams, but includes the instilling of discipline and a respect for order in the girls under its charge.\"If you want order, you can't have everybody doing what they like. It's not just about passing exams. There are other things we want to instil over the two years,\" said Reid.She continued: \"For us, education is not about getting 10 ones in CXC (Caribbean Examinations Council exams). We have several girls in grade seven who can get several ones if we allowed them to take the exams, but that is not what education is about for us at St Andrew.\"The principal made it clear that she was not suggesting that her school's approach is right and the ministry's position is wrong.DIFFICULT TO ACCOMMODATEReid argued that, because of the school's thinking on education, creating programmes to facilitate students who want to sit the exams early would be difficult to accommodate.She also dismissed the claim that the school insists its students sit the exams at grade 11 because it is trying to prop up its pass rate.\"That would be very shallow thinking. St Andrew's policy predates that. The school is  87 years old. We are not so hung up ... . It is to do with our philosophy of education.\"Reid said the school is prepared to fight if the education ministry issues an edict outlawing the resitting of exams in grade 11 if a child has already passed the subject.\"I am sure that my board would challenge it, but I am sure the ministry will accept dialogue.

I prefer if you get it from the ministry,\" he added.The national security ministry did not respond to questions our news team sent last Friday.However, Sunday Gleaner sources have revealed that the DCS and the ministry are caught between a rock and a hard place.According to the well-placed source, one of the plans on the table is moving the male inmates from the South Camp Adult Correctional Centre, a maximum-security prison, and placing them at the other two already overcrowded maximum-security facilities, Tower Street and St Catherine.The source said this is the more dangerous of the two leading options being considered, as overcrowding poses clear and present dangers and difficult challenges.The other option is the construction of a new prison. But, the cash-strapped Government might be less inclined to go this route.In September 2011, Dr St Aubyn Bartlett, then state minister in the national security ministry under the Jamaica Labour Party government, made it clear that the Government could not afford to build a new prison.At that time, Bartlett told The Gleaner that the construction of new correctional facilities would have to be driven by private individuals as the Government is strapped for cash.He also told our news team that the national security ministry was searching for lands to relocate the St Catherine-based Fort Augusta Adult Correctional Centre because the Port Authority of Jamaica was seeking to expand and redevelop the Port of Kingston.The lands of Jamaica's sole female prison, as well as surrounding parcels, were sold to the Port Authority close to a decade ago as part of redevelopment plans for the Port of Kingston.Transport Minister Dr Omar Davies recently announced that the Port Authority has received a proposal from China Harbour Engineering Company Limited (CHEC) expressing an interest in providing private investment to develop a new container terminal on lands already owned by the authority as well as lands to be created by dredging at Fort Augusta.According to Davies, the Cabinet has given approval for the Port Authority to proceed with the implementation of a non-binding memorandum of understanding with CHEC for the development of a container terminal at Fort Augusta.This is expected to use most of the 50 acres (125 hectares which now house the prison and surrounding lands.tyrone.reid@gleanerjm.com\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7330, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4c9b85a1f92f9943", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:41.650", "title": "Garveyism alive in Jamaica", "occurred_at": "2012-08-19T06:13:10", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120819/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Daraine Luton,\u00a0 Senior Staff ReporterMore concerns over procurement rulesCalls for changes to the procurement rules for government transactions have increased as Jamaica stumbles in its attempt to take advantage of developments in critical sectors such as energy.\"I am personally convinced that the rules and the fear of just being off the line .... have driven inaction for the simplest thing,\" adviser to the prime minister and head of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) steering committee Dr Carlton Davis told a Gleaner Editors' Forum last week.\"If it takes high policy to say this is what we have to do for the national interest, say it to the country and go to the Parliament.

I think that is unacceptable,\" said Zacca, as he also addressed the Editors' Forum. much criticismThe Office of the Contractor General (OCG), now led by Greg Christie, is tasked with policing the procurement rules and Christie has faced much criticism for some of his actions.But Zacca says the problem is not with the OCG but the procurement guidelines.\"Greg Christie is only enforcing the rules that have been given to him by the Parliament of Jamaica,\" said Zacca.Davis readily agrees. \"The rules have been carried out as they have been laid out, and they have been carried out with enthusiasm.\"He argued that the energy sector requires special treatment and should be subject to different rules as it relates to procurement.Davis noted that as part of Jamaica's push to introduce LNG, one of the things that the Government speculated on is whether it should have a preferred bidder for the infrastructure or negotiate with the two entities which had submitted technically sound bids.\"We sought legal advice and we were told to play the ball straight, take no risk because that's our procurement rule.\"According to Davis, Jamaica needs to move now on energy or miss opportunities, which could set the country back for many years.\"This energy thing is of such moment that it cannot be a slave so completely to methodology and rules that you get straight As for methodology and rules and straight Bs for effectiveness and economics,\" said Davis.Davis and Zacca's call for changes to the procurement guidelines has the full support of Minister of Transport, Works and Housing Dr Omar Davies.\"The whole procurement process, it is lengthy, and does not necessarily guarantee the equity and the transparency,\" Davies told The Sunday Gleaner.That came as no surprise because Davies is the Government's point man in a dispute with the OCG over three projects and the establishment of an independent oversight panel (IOP) to monitor them.heart of a disputeThe procurement guidelines are at the heart of a dispute involving Minister of Transport, Works and Housing Dr Omar Davies and the OCG.In April, Davies announced in Parliament that the Cabinet had established the IOP to advise it on the implementation of three megaprojects, two of which had not received the blessing of Christie.At that time, Davies said the administration, \"will not allow the OCG to be a stumbling block in the engagement of private entities as the State moves to take advantage of investment opportunities\".Christie immediately responded, arguing that the establishment of the IOP was an attempt to usurp the OCG.\"The OCG takes strong offence and exception to any suggestion that is made that by virtue of the discharge of its lawful mandates, under the Contractor General Act, as is prescribed by the Parliament of Jamaica, and which it is sworn to do, that it is impeding economic growth and development in Jamaica,\" said Christie.The projects are the north-south Highway 2000 link, Gordon Cay container transhipment hub, and the Fort Augusta container terminal.According to Davies, were it not for the intervention of the OCG last year, the Chinese investors would have long advanced work on the north-south link of Highway 2000.\"I have just reviewed the files which reported on former Minister Audley Shaw's visit to Beijing, and a year ago, they were at a stage where had we proceeded, the Mount Rosser bypass would now be complete,\" Davies said last month.That did not phase Christie, who has consistently argued that the OCG was set up to ensure that government contracts and licences are void of irregularity, impropriety and corruption.\"The OCG is of the view that economic development must be pursued in a sustainable and responsible manner, and within an appropriate system of institutionalised and independent checks and balances which will ensure that the Jamaican taxpayer can be guaranteed value for money and that all government commercial transactions will withstand the highest levels of scrutiny and probity.\"The parties are now before the courts for a determination on whether the OCG can dictate members of the IOP to report to it.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7331, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/062cf3cf36674f8d", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:42.127", "title": "Central

Government's long-announced plan to introduce liquefied natural gas (LNG) as one measure to reduce electricity rates remains in limbo with no clear indication, when, or if, this will take place.The proposed 2014 timeline will not be met and the man leading the process, Dr Carlton Davis, is not committing himself to a new timeline.\"We will soon know the full truth,\" Davis told a recent Gleaner Editors' Forum as he noted that the State is now ready to start negotiations with Samsung, which has been selected to construct the LNG infrastructure locally.\"We have just about completed the process of looking at the price quotations of the liquefied gas and within another couple of weeks we will determine whether the whole thing makes senses and if it makes sense how fast we move on it,\" said Davis.Under the original plan supported by successive administrations, LNG would be added to the country's fuel mix, replacing oil to sharply reduce the country's energy bill while lowering the price of electricity to consumers.The plan was made on the assumption that the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) would construct a new 360 megawatts power plant in Old Harbour Bay, St Catherine, by 2014.The JPS has indicated that the plant should be up and running by 2014, but recent concerns from potential financial partners have left a cloud around that project.The company is also yet to say if it will proceed with the building of the new plant if the Government fails to deliver LNG.price discussionLast Thursday, the Government's technical team reviewed the proposals for the supply of the gas and this week, the LNG steering committee will meet to discuss the price of the gas before making a recommendation to the Cabinet.\"We have the quotations for the infrastructure, we have the quotations for the price of the LNG ... there are financial security issues ... all these put together will give us a pretty good idea of where we are, then we will meet (and make a decision),\" Davis told the Editors' Forum.\"Issues as to whether we are going to abandon that path wholly or partially will be determined. The real question is whether the JPS will find the price that (the LNG) comes out to at a sufficient comfort level ... to give the public a price of electricity that is much lower than they currently pay,\" added Davis.If LNG can be sourced at an acceptable price, the JPS could reduce the fuel cost to its customers by approximately 40 per cent.According to Davis, \"Circumstances will dictate where we go from here. As I said, in just a matter of days we will know what sort of game is on, if a game is on in a certain direction.\"However, despite the price concerns which could derail the project, Davis did not comment on the Government's decision to select Samsung as its preferred bidder to do the LNG infrastructure when its offer was higher than the bid entered by EXMAR.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7332, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ef62792a3c312157", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:43.823", "title": "Wellington pushes for Ja Brahman development", "occurred_at": "2012-08-19T06:13:10", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120818/lead/lead4.html", "data": "Christopher Serju, Gleaner WriterDENBIGH, Clarendon:WHILE IT was the impressive showing of the Red Poll animals which resulted in him sweeping the top awards in the Beef Cattle segment at this year's Denbigh Agricultural, Industrial and Food Show, livestock geneticist Dr Karl Wellington has been pushing for the development of another breed - the Jamaica Brahman.Supreme Champion Beef Bull, Supreme Champion Junior, Supreme Champions Male and Female and Best Three animals, were among the awards Wellington's animals won en route to him copping the coveted Breeders Cup trophy.However, the victory of Treason, a 1,630 pound three-year and eight-month-old animal, which was judged Grand Champion Brahman Bull, was particularly pleasing for the veteran cattle breeder.He told The Gleaner: \"That is a polled Brahman bull, a strain of animal that I've been working with since 1987 and trying to get others interested in. There are a few, but sad to say not enough, persons participating in the development of polled Brahman that is a special strain of animals with no horn, which is an economic value.Polled is a term for livestock without horns in species which are usually horned. The term refers both to breeds and strain which are naturally polled through selective breeding and also to naturally horned animals which have been dehorned.Safer, Easier to handleWellington continues to make a case for more farmers to invest in the polled Jamaica Brahman: \"If you are trucking 40 horned animals, in that space you could take 45 or so. In terms of safety for the handlers, there are less problems relating to handling the animals.\"Brahman are also known for their herding instinct in which it has been observed that once one animals starts moving or behaving in a certain way the others will follow. They will investigate intruders (humans and animals) and this has been shown to be a defensive advantage.Wellington attests to this: \"In my Brahman herds any time I go there I don't need to call them or drive them, they hear my vehicle coming and they'll come up to the gate. Ten other vehicles can pass and they just ignore and stay where they are and feed.\"The other thing is that if I go into a herd, and this happens to me quite often in the afternoon, in no time the entire herd of animals, 25 or 30 heifers make a complete circle around me and because I am not sure of their intention, I always have a stick in my hand but they have never attacked me. They have attacked me when I try to take a calf away or marking a calf or so. I got a few butts here and there but not as serious as it would be if they had horns.\"He is convinced that the Brahman herds' defensive instinct helps in some way to control praedial larceny. \"On my farm, I have found on a number of occasions, calves in the pasture, with an unknown rope tied around the neck, but obviously the mother defended her case and the calf was not missing, whereas up to two weeks ago I missed a 4-month old calf from the Red Poll herd,\" related Wellington.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7333, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9183a7d87d46bf8c", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:44.246", "title": "Don't seek US help with IMF talks - Shaw", "occurred_at": "2012-08-19T06:13:10", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120818/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Gary Spaulding,\u00a0 Senior Gleaner WriterEven as Finance Minister Dr Peter Phillips sought to assure Jamaicans that his negotiating team was fine-tuning plans to present to the high-level team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which is due in the island next month, Opposition Spokesman on Finance Audley Shaw is frowning on a reported move by the Government to solicit political favours from the United States (US) government.Phillips told The Gleaner that he intends to have definitive proposals on public sector transformation, pension reform and the planned rationalisation of tax waivers ready ahead of the September 25 visit by the IMF.Stressing that the outline of the plans was ready, Phillips told The Gleaner that the Government would be racing the clock as it finalised preparations for the upcoming talks in a bid to hammer out an agreement before the end of the year. \"We are actively preparing for the mission to come in September,\" the finance minister asserted.\"All the preparations and programming work are in full gear and all the elements of the programme are advancing ... we are moving to implement, even before the IMF comes, some or all the elements of a new (tax) waiver policy which includes the rationalisation of the waiver system,\" Phillips disclosed.However, Shaw called on Phillips to focus on dealing expeditiously with the outstanding issues delaying a new IMF agreement, instead of asking the US Government for political support in dealing with the IMF.US interferenceShaw noted that Phillips was quoted in a newspaper story saying that, \"Jamaica is mainly hoping that political support from the United States will help to encourage the IMF to move swiftly in approving a new programme.\"\"Instead of graciously accepting the offer of the US Government for technical assistance, we are now faced with the spectre of Jamaica asking the Government of the United States to, in effect, interfere with the decision-making process at the IMF,\" said Shaw.\"This is unworthy of the minister, who should abandon that strategy and seek instead to fast track the implementation of the critical benchmark requirements that can lead to a credible medium-term programme that is acceptable to the IMF and all other stakeholders including the people of Jamaica.\"\"There are active discussions taking place with the trade unions in relation to the 2012 period going forward,\" the finance minister said. \"We are also moving to receive and act on a report from the parliamentary committee on pension reforms.\"Phillips stressed that, notwithstanding the misgivings and apprehensions, some elements of the Public Sector Pension Reform will be implemented during the course of this current fiscal year.He said there was a meeting of the sub-committee of Cabinet examining public sector transformation. \"It is very much on the table.

After pondering it for a while, the young man filed it away.Last week Friday when results were released online, details of the dream came back to him, so he positioned himself in front of the computer exactly as he was in the dream and logged on.Scizar saw that he had in fact got all ones in the 10 subjects - physics, chemistry, biology, human and social biology, geography, principles of accounts, principles of business, mathematics, English language and English literature.He burst out laughing.\"My heart was in my mouth as I waited for the results to come up, because that night everyone was stressing because of what Minister (of Education) Ronald Thwaites was saying about the results this year. When I saw all ones coming up I just laughed and began clapping myself,\" he said.The 17-year-old went to tell his father Michael Samuels who declared that the results were just a confirmation of what he already knew. His mother Sophia Dunn, family and friends all rejoiced.\"When I told my friends they said they expected it because I was a motivation and inspiration for them for the past five years, which I was unaware of,\" said the young man, who was always one of Wolmer's Boys' top performers.The years of hard work, sleepless nights, consistent studying, going over past papers as well as helping his friends have paid off, but he knows this is just the beginning.\"I feel really great about it but I know I have so much more to achieve, this is just the foundation for better things to come,\" he stated.Addressing the growing concerns that the girls were far outdoing the boys academically, Scizar said what he had observed was that far too many boys were focusing on \"the now\", always talking about the latest trends and partying. The girls, on the other hand, had a focused determination, setting themselves a future goal and working towards it.\"I see a lot of the boys more attracted to the party scene and the dancehall music, and while I see some girls like that, they tend to have more determination and want to have a stable future and not depend on any man. We live in an age now where women are becoming more and more independent,\" he stated.Boys need 'big brothers' The young man feels boys need more 'big brother' role models in their lives to motivate and push them to higher, tangible achievements.\"For me, I have a dream that I want to fulfil and my father and grandfather (Noel Samuels) always tell me that 'if yuh want good yuh nose haffi run'. Sometimes it is heart-rending to see other guys getting to do things I would want to do at this age, but I have to swallow my pride and hit the books,\" he expressed.\"I always say the loudest man at the party is always the brokest. They might be living the high life now, but if they don't buckle down, they will not be living it in the future, unless God bless them to make a change in their lives.\"For students planning to sit CSEC next year, Scizar advises them to have an open mind towards the subjects they fear they won't do well in and don't blame or depend on teachers, but do their own work, research and studying.\"They should also exercise, because it helps you to concentrate and remember. Exercise causes more blood to flow to your brain and helps with your thinking ability,\" he shared.Scizar moves on to sixth form this September, where he is hoping to cop all ones in Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE) to take him into medical studies at university, and toward his dream of becoming a neurosurgeon.anastasia.cunningham@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7336, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1036b6b715467ca1", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:50.658", "title": "Jamaican-Canadians join in jubilee celebrations", "occurred_at": "2012-08-19T06:13:10", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120818/lead/lead71.html", "data": "Members of the diaspora in Canada were not to be left out of Jamaica 50 celebrations.Founding president of the Jamaica Diaspora Canada, Philip Mascoll, explained that Jamaican-Canadians were 'feeling it' early.\"We got off to a fairly quick start.

Regrettably, many made the ultimate sacrifice while being members of the British military fighting the Nazis during the wars (WWI, 1914-1918; WWII, 1934-1945). Those who made it home were not forgotten. In the 1950s, Curphey Home was established under the direction of the Jamaican Legion to nurture the needs of our war veterans, especially in their senior years.Sitting on 54 acres of land in south Manchester, six miles to the south of Mandeville, it remains the place of comfort for 13 former soldiers, including one female, who served Jamaica with distinction. Among the group is 90-year-old John Lloyd Wint, and a former member of the Royal Air Force. The brother of Jamaica's first Olympic gold medallist, Arthur Wint, he remains mentally sharp and is in good health. When The Gleaner visited the home, he was busy having lunch while watching television. He, however, interrupted his lunch to offer his welcome.CHALLENGESWhile the care being given to the soldiers is exceptional and the facility is immaculately clean, it still faces many challenges.Superintendent Irwin, who is in charge of Curphey Home, said the main problem results from a lack of piped water, and the closing down of the mining company, Alpart, which used to assist the home with the commodity.

Earlier this year the Canadian Government donated $62 million (CAD$705,000) to Jamaica as part of ongoing initiatives to bolster the island's anti-crime and anti-corruption programmes.The money is to construct a 'Centre of Excellence' for polygraph training, as well as to train additional polygraph examiners and will be carried out in collaboration with the College of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, where some of the training will be conducted.Up to 2009, the 43-year-old senior officer was one of two law enforcement officers who were specially trained as forensic polygraphers.

Under the INDECOM Act, a revision of the law has to be carried out within a three-year period. The bill was passed in August 2010.Opposition to proposalAndrew Johnson, a senior police officer who attended the forum, warned that conferring more powers, including prosecutorial remit, on INDECOM, could erode the Constitutional rights of officers under investigations.Williams, however, argued that INDECOM would not be treated as a judge who presides over court cases and, therefore, could not overstep its bounds. \"It would have as much power as a commission of enquiry has,\" he argued.INDECOM and the statute governing its mandate have been dragged before the court since it came into existence.The Constitutional Court in May dismissed a motion brought by eight policemen who were contending that INDECOM did not have the power to compel them to give statements in relation to a fatal shooting.However, INDECOM remains without the authority to prosecute the cases it probes.INDECOM is currently operating at two thirds of its maximum capacity with an investigative complement of 55 out of the required 80, with 20 administrative personnel.In endorsing Golding's sentiment that the Office of the DPP was overburdened, Munroe expressed the view that the Constitutional arrangements under which the DPP falls are in urgent need of reconfiguration. \"There is no way that a single office can carry out such a workload,\" Munroe declared.Golding agreed. \"I am of the view that there is a place for certain agencies to be conferred with the powers to prosecute the cases that they investigate, because I think it would lead to a more effective carrying out of their mandate.\"The DPP has under its remit prosecutorial powers from about 12 public-sector bodies.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7348, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7d5bb5a7e2d2feab", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:45:57.301", "title": "A bright spark", "occurred_at": "2012-08-17T02:42:40", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120817/lead/lead1.html", "data": "Nadisha Hunter and Lauren Williams, Gleaner WritersEducation Minister Ronald Thwaites has indicated that only 16 per cent of the island's educators who specialise in mathematics are competent enough to teach the subject in the classroom.Thwaites made the claim while speaking at a Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) and Partners Co-operative Credit Union Ltd 2012 scholarship awards presentation at the Knutsford Court hotel in New Kingston, yesterday.However, Jamaica Teachers' Association (JTA) president Paul Adams thinks the statistic is unbelievable as teachers continue to upgrade themselves with the needed skills to manipulate the different subject areas.\"The teachers\n have upgraded themselves over the past 20 to 30 years so it is with the\n skills, knowledge and competence of the teachers that we are able to \nsee better results in the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate \n(CSEC),\" Adams told The Gleaner. \"The only areas (in \neducation) that have improved over the past 30 years are the quality, \nqualification and competence of the teachers.

the JPS; its directors and financiers are inevitably affected by uncertainty about any near-term change of that licence, as it has been obtained on the basis of both generation and transmission of electricity.\"In looking ahead, therefore, at the prospects for investment in alternative sources of energy, the Government, on behalf of the people, has to examine all options,\" said the OPM. \"In the short run, it must ensure continuity of service while it seeks to give the country the best chance of finding cheaper sources of energy and more affordable electricity for all consumers and for the productive sector.\"\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7361, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/265c9162aa7ed3c1", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:06.116", "title": "Monopoly is best", "occurred_at": "2012-08-16T06:57:00", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120816/lead/lead1.html", "data": "Nadisha Hunter, Staff ReporterImmaculate High student cops 15 ones in CSEC examsTchakamau Ra, 16, was by no means surprised by her superb performance in the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) examinations after gaining 16 subjects, 15 with grade one.For her, it was only reward for the hard work and dedication she had displayed while she was preparing for the examinations.Tchakamau sat 10 subjects at Immaculate High School, where she attended and was home schooled by her mother, Kamau Mahakoe, and father, senior lecturer at Edna Manly College for the Visual and performing Arts, Omari Ra, for the other six subjects.Tchakamau was also home schooled, up to high school at which time her mother, Mahakoe, set a rigid study timetable for her.\"It felt amazing when I saw the results.

And rightly so. It's not every day that a couple achieves this feat at the same time. Even louder cheers filled the sweltering gymnatorium at the Northern Caribbean University (NCU), when upon receiving their diplomas, the happy graduates sealed the achievement with a kiss.But, just how did they arrive at this feat? The Gleaner spoke to Drs Phillip and Donna Powell-Wilson about the journey. The Wilsons have been married for four of the 10 years since they met. They opted to tackle their doctorates in 2002 after completing their master's degrees together. \"My husband wanted a study partner so he asked me to do it, she revealed. They selected different topics, and she also completed a second master's degree during the period after getting a scholarship.\"He continued in the field of leadership, and I focused on curriculum instruction,\" Powell-Wilson, a Kingstonian said; her husband is from Wait-A-Bit, Trelawny.Currently head of the Mathematics department at the Shortwood Teachers College, Mrs Wilson said she is characterised as someone who cannot remain quiet for long. \"It is a milestone achievement,\" she said of the PhD, but with both of them coming from large families, and being the only ones to attain that level of education, they had ample motivation.\"It is my philosophy that education is the only path out of a humble situation. Through education, I will be able to achieve anything,\" she stressed. The journey for Powell-Wilson has been fraught with adversity as she lost her mother during her second year of teachers' college and three of her nine siblings later. But, she said there were some very supportive persons around, chief among them her church family at Elim Open Bible in Portmore, St Catherine.Long journey many challengesThere were sacrifices too as, with her husband being principal of St Thomas Technical High School, both had to give up all school vacation, public holidays and weekends to travel to Mandeville for studies. But it was all worth it. For Powell-Wilson, her future projects could include starting a family. Her husband told The Gleaner that he would be continuing to work in the area of clinical supervision of his teachers to make them more positively impact students and special courses with sixth formers.\"I will also be doing some writing and analysis to assist other PhD candidates,\" he said. Dr Wilson met his wife when both were at Denham Town High School. As their relationship blossomed, they decided to become life partners in the pursuit of academic excellence. The years of study were challenging, and he even felt guilty about watching TV occasionally. \"I can now enjoy myself and devote my time to St Thomas,\" he said.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7370, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6207deb1048fa429", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:10.200", "title": "This day in 1962", "occurred_at": "2012-08-16T06:57:00", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120815/lead/lead95.html", "data": "JAMAICA's historical landscape is littered with dates which have shaped the terrain as well as the future of the country's diverse inhabitants.These events range from catastrophic to euphoric with no shortage of recollection whenever the various milestones are mentioned.From earthquakes, hurricanes and fires to Olympic glory and Independence, The Gleaner started chronicling Jamaica's roller-coaster history ride in 1834, and has had a front-row seat at every major event since.With 2012 marking Jamaica's 50th year of Independence from Great Britain, The Gleaner continues to share events which made the news, this day, in 1962.Busta going to PM's parley in LondonSir Alexander Bustamante has been invited to attend the next meeting of Commonwealth prime ministers in London, beginning September 10.Sir Alexander is to reply, accepting the invitation, and it is reported he will be accompanied to the meeting by Donald Sangster, minister of finance.This will be the first time that West Indian ministers will be attending a meeting of Commonwealth prime ministers.

According to Christie, one of the companies selected by Kellier is owned by his brother.In a Gleaner/Power 106 News interview yesterday, Kellier hit back saying his brother was a registered contractor who is entitled to work in Jamaica.Kellier admitted he made recommendations to the NWA, but argued that the final decision rested with the accounting officer at the government agency.He stressed that it was normal operating procedures.Kellier also dismissed as nonsense suggestions that he might have influenced the process in favour of his brother.In a release yesterday, Christie pointed out that official NWA documents, sequestered by his office during a visit to the agency's St James Parish Office, showed that at least one of the alleged contracts, amounting to $270,000, was awarded in December 2010 by the NWA upon the specific written instructions of one \"Derrick Kellier, CD, MP, South St James\" to M &amp; K Heavy Equipment Hireage Co.

Ltd, for the execution of certain specified works, at certain specified locations.The specified works and locations match exactly the works specifications that one \"Derrick F. Kellier\" had previously communicated to the NWA, in writing, as works that he wanted the NWA to execute.The OCG is moving to investigate the particulars of the contracts that have been subject to the alleged arrangement.In addition, the oversight body is seeking to ascertain whether the prescribed Government of Jamaica Procurement Procedures and CDF guidelines were complied with in the award of the contracts.The OCG said it would also seek to determine whether the contracts were awarded impartially and on merit and in circumstances that did not involve impropriety or irregularity.The findings of the probe will be submitted to Parliament.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7374, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/26b94bbabc0125d0", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:13.375", "title": "Olympic lottery haul", "occurred_at": "2012-08-16T06:57:00", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120815/lead/lead7.html", "data": "Daviot Kelly, Staff ReporterCashiers couldn't move their hands fast enough yesterday as gamblers cashed in on 'Olympic numbers' at Supreme Ventures Limited (SVL) outlets.In the Corporate Area, personnel at the Sagicor Centre outlet said the crowd was massive, while other outlets also reportedly saw                                           above-average sales.

I believe that when you analyse any objective data, the thing comes down to the price you will be paying for the fuel, and the efficiency with which we convert that fuel to electrical energy,\" Davis said.He added: \"To me, overcoming those problems exceeds all the other things about transmission and distribution. I am not persuaded as to the gains you would make in terms of breaking up transmission and distribution.\"ONE GRID, MULTIPLE PLAYERSDr Maurice McNaughton, from the University of the West Indies, Mona's energy think tank, said liberalising does not necessarily mean having several parties operating various grids.\"I don't know that when we think about having multiple players it leads to this single scenario where you have a broken-up grid and different people operating pieces of the grid. I think what it means is access to the grid where you could have multiple players where there is a single operator of the grid,\" he said.McNaughton said the scenario would allow for power wheeling and interconnection, and warned that the correct structure must be in place to ensure its success.In its 2011 election manifesto, the People's National Party (PNP), then in opposition, said a PNP-led administration would give effect to the policy to liberalise the energy sector.DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONSYesterday, Davis said there appears to be different interpretations about what is meant by unbundling.\"I am of the view, in this whole energy thing, to get my priorities right. My highest priority is a fuel that is reliable over the long term and is, in the long term, likely to be less expensive than we are with oil,\" Davis said.He also argued that the second major priority should be to replace outdated equipment, especially in the bauxite sector.The Government is hoping that the introduction of LNG will reduce Jamaica's energy costs by 40 per cent.daraine.luton@gleanerjm.com \n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7376, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/07e6126ecdf03b33", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:14.928", "title": "I'm no Usain Bolt - Obama", "occurred_at": "2012-08-14T08:53:23", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120815/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Triple London 2012 Olympic champion Usain Bolt has refused to compete in the United Kingdom (UK) again until the country changes its tax laws.The Jamaican sprinter, who won gold medals in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay at the Games in London, objects to a law that sees him taxed on global sponsorship and endorsement earnings as well as any appearance fee when he competes in Britain.And despite setting a new world record during the Olympics, the 25-year-old, who has been reported to earn around US$20 million (J$1.8 billion) a year, says his UK-based fans won't see him compete until the tax laws are loosened.\"As soon as the law changes, I'll be here all the time,\" Bolt said. \"I love being here.

Davidson's comments came moments after he emerged from a meeting with JADCO board members who spent the greater part of yesterday combing through their database to find evidence to back up the claim by the IOC official.No evidenceThe members turned up empty-handed in their search.\"What Mr (Dick) Pound said was blatantly false. We knew it was spurious, but we spent the whole day trying to find evidence of it,\" Davidson said.\"We don't think they would do this to America and other bigger  countries. It is a vicious attack on a small country,\" Davidson fumed. On Saturday, Pound, IOC member and former chief of the World Anti-Doping Committee, told Reuters Television that Jamaican athletes belong to \"one of the groups that are hard to test\". \"It is hard to get in and find them, and so forth,\" Reuters quoted Pound as saying. No complaints But yesterday, JADCO's acting chairman, in rubbishing Pound's statement, said: \"This is confirmed by the fact that the World Anti-Doping Agency database, Anti-Doping Administration and Management System, holding such information of all tests and missed tests do not confirm his allegation.\" Additionally, he said JADCO has never received any complaints regarding the athletes not being found for testing. \"JADCO is acutely aware that the Jamaican athletes by their high level of performance will attract the attention of the world and therefore, every track-and-field athlete representing Jamaica at the recent Olympics was tested in competition in June 2012,\" Davidson said. \"In conjunction with the International Association of Athletics Federations, elite athletes were tested more than once.

The Jamaican team has again performed with distinction and invariably is yet again in the spotlight. Hundreds of Jamaicans from all over the world descended on London to witness an Olympic Games that was well planned and generally well executed. I took the time to speak to a few fans to get their views on the moments they considered special in the overall experience.The general view was that the 200m 1, 2, 3 was the ultimate highlight. As with the 100m women in Beijing, China, three Jamaicans crossed the line in front, but this time it was the men who provided the special moment.Ian Moore and Evon Berry, who witnessed both events, were undecided as to which gave them more joy. Another group of fans pointed out that they already knew where the gold and silver medals would hang in the 200m and as such, their only interest was to see if Warren Weir could cop the bronze.We were reminded that Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce was the one who started the gold-mining exercise and it invariably set the tone for the rest of the games.Stacy-Ann Young, an ardent fan, was euphoric at the sight of Usain Bolt streaking away from Ryan Bailey to break the world record in the 4x100 relay. In the pandemonium she was caught on camera hugging a complete stranger in full view of his wife who was sitting in the adjacent seat. We had a great laugh after the clip was reviewed by a keen British fan who had videotaped the entire scene.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7382, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/92ac84cd92c232d2", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:18.929", "title": "Sherwood Content still in neglect", "occurred_at": "2012-08-14T08:53:23", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120814/lead/lead7.html", "data": "Mark Titus, Gleaner WriterWESTERN BUREAU:While the birthplaces and special landmarks of many local heroes have been duly recognised by the state, Sherwood Content in Trelawny - the home town of international athletic sensation Usain Bolt - still lies in neglect.\"Absolutely nothing has been done to symbolise his achievements,\" the track star's aunt, Lillian 'Aunt Lillie' Bolt told The Gleaner yesterday.\"The community has been without running water for years and although tourists continue to visit us on a daily basis to find out more about Bolt, the authorities have failed to capitalise on his success.\"Community member Jeremy Downer, a 25-year-old teacher at William Knibb High School, said a sign to mark the locale is welcomed.\"Many (persons) are curious about the yam and come to sample what it is that is said to make Usain go so fast, and although we are not big on farming here, neither is there any structured arrangement or plan to facilitate this, not even a signpost to say this is Bolt's country,\" Downer stated.\"All it really takes is smart governance. Everyone would benefit and our economy would improve.\"In fact, except for road work done on sections of the Martha Brae roadway leading into Sherwood Content, all improvements were done or spearheaded by Bolt.These include underwriting the $120,000 bill to rewire the Sherwood Content Basic School, and contributing $1.4 million of the $3.5 million used to refurbish the Sherwood Content Health Centre.Bolt also donated fire-safety equipment to five basic schools in and around his community.Plans for playing fieldThe six-time Olympic gold medallist also has plans to renovate the community centre and playing field, but sources close to the situation said he was yet to receive a requested proposal for the project.Bolt first proved his credentials on the world stage by winning the 200 metres before a home crowd in Kingston at the IAAF World Junior Championships in 2002. He later rose to international prominence after shattering the 100m and 200m world records during the Olympic Games in Beijing, China, in 2008. He repeated the feat during the World Championships in Berlin, Germany, the following year, becoming one of the world's most popular athletes in the process.But the 25-year-old phenom was not finished, securing his sixth Olympic gold medal and eighth world record, after anchoring Jamaica's men's 4x100m relay team to a 36.84 seconds win, making them the first team to breach the 37 seconds barrier at the just concluded London Olympics.However, his dreamforSherwood Content is to construct a multi-purpose complex, which would include amuseum, that would not only display his achievements, but also provideemployment opportunities for residents in the community.Pit latrinesThe sprinter's alma mater, Waldensia Primary School, still relies on pit latrines for its teachers and students, and is without a playing field.Bolt aside, the community has a strong ecotourism or heritage-tourism potential, having a rich post-colonial history and several dilapidated 19th century houses dating back to the days of William Knibb.\"Well, it is left to be seen, what will happen this time around,\" commented 'Aunt Lillie' as she supervised work on her soon-to-be-opened gift shop.\"He has done us proud.

Matalon told The Gleaner yesterday that the company has been losing a substantial sum.\"What this Government is trying to do now is to cut all the loss items out of the railway, so we are going to be doing reorganisation of the railway company in preparation for a divestment of the company,\" Matalon said.Quizzed about the failed attempts at divestment in the past, Matalon explained that the previous efforts were contingent on a Government guarantee for the resuscitation of the railway.\"What we are trying to do now is to develop a terms of reference that does not include or specifically denies any potential guarantee from the Government of Jamaica. It must be a total operation by a private investor,\" he stressed.The service was introduced last year to facilitate commuters during the closure of the Bog Walk gorge and to minimise disruption of the pipe-laying work by the National Water Commission.A release from the Transport Ministry stated yesterday that since the reopening of the gorge, the service has proven to be uneconomical and, as such, a decision was made to terminate the service.Matalon said the ridership has declined significantly since the reopening of the gorge.He said the decision would not have a significant impact on travel.edmond.campbell@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7385, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d97072a83bc34221", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:20.805", "title": "No dopers allowed", "occurred_at": "2012-08-14T08:53:23", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120814/lead/lead1.html", "data": "Nedburn Thaffe, Gleaner WriterLocal anti-doping boss blasts IOC member for 'false' claims about athletesChairman of the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission (JADCO), Professor Winston Davidson, is describing claims by a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), that it is difficult to find and test Jamaican athletes, as \"a vicious attack on a small country\".

We have also been looking at international research and trends, and these will be used to determine the methodologies which will be used going forward,\" said Radcliffe.He said the results of the research indicated that boys do indeed learn differently from girls, and that they responded to a practical-oriented curriculum, delivering much better results.He said as part of this new initiative, there would be significant training of teachers, both at the teachers' college level and among those already in the system.Radcliffe acknowledged that there would be a challenge in implementing the programme in co-educational institutions, but said a suitable solution was being explored.Education Minister Ronald Thwaites added that the results from this year's Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) were a typical example of girls continuing to excel far above the level of boys.He noted that in CSEC English literature, of the 3,843 students who passed with grade one, 1,079 were boys and 2,764 girls.\"More than double the girls got a grade one  ... . I wonder who the girls are going to marry,\" Thwaites said.\"There is a deficit here, and we have to make sure that we pay particular attention to this.\"He said, of interest, the Grade Six Achievement Test (GSAT) results were improving, therefore, there was a breakdown between GSAT and CSEC.\"There is something not happening in our secondary schools that we need to analyse very carefully,\" he said.The minister added that the problem must be the concern of every single individual, and, in particular, the parents of boys must ensure that they are avid about ensuring the performance of their sons.Thwaites also revealed that for the new academic year, the ministry would be engaging \"strong leaders\" from the cadet corps and scouts movement, with the intention of expanding uniformed groups in every school.\"We have evidence that the students that are engaged in structured activity, particularly uniformed activity, tend to be better disciplined, organised, and do better, and are more socially oriented,\" he said.Radcliffe ...

He bought the downed plane at Tinson Pen in 2000 without consulting his wife.\"When I told her I bought it, she said 'Yuh do wha'?\" he laughed. He admitted that at the time, he didn't know what he wanted to do with the plane.\"I just know I wanted it, but I couldn't explain why. I just had this vision to put it on a chassis,\" he said.One day, it came to him: make it into an SUV and carry people around his 26-acre property, which has children's rides and even has a cave.\"God gi mi di inspiration. I give God thanks and praise for giving me the wisdom,\" he said. He and his six-member crew are fixing up the 'automobile' to also host a wedding reception the day after we visited them. The bride and groom were adamant they would be transported, along with their bridal party, in his creation. So the plan is to use it for similar events as well. The plane, named Sweet and Dandy, can hold 12 people comfortably. Since learning of his plans, the quiet community and surrounding areas have been talking about it.\"People called us mad and stupid, enuh,\" he laughed. \"But sometimes they mean well; it's just a way of expressing themselves. Now, every day dem ask when di plane going to come?\"Excitement aplentyThe excitement went sky high on Friday, August 3, though, when, after getting the necessary permission and escort from the police, Archer and his crew took it to Kitson Town Square.\"If we never careful, wi kill people because everyone was coming close trying to see it. The place mash up. It was pure excitement,\" he said. \"We started with one car piloting us. By the time we got to Kitson Town, it was about 10.\"But how does it drive? Archer said it handles just like an SUV, \"it's just longer\". The mechanics have put in a four-speed manual transmission V-8 engine. Archer said top speed is about 90mph.\"It can go faster than that, man,\" laughed Aggrey Sutherland, one of his mechanics. But Archer isn't too keen to go much faster.\"Anything over 40, those things (planes) looking to tek off wid yuh,\" he grinned. He is confident he will get the necessary permits to take Sweet and Dandy out on the road when necessary. But there's also the cave, a part of his plane/car tour plans. The hangar/garage will be called Carry Go Bring Come Airport.\"I have hosted wedding receptions in the cave. We can hold up to 100 people,\" he said, noting that they would also want to host school groups. \"After you talk to them about the cave, then they want some excitement (the plane tour). The cave is a natural attraction. We even have dances down there. There is a naturally formed landing area where the DJs set up,\" he said.He hopes to finish the plane by September, and spruce up the cave by the end of the year. His dream is in sight. But there have been bumps along this flight. When looking for the right chassis for the plane, he bought a Leyland truck and a Chevy pick-up that just couldn't fit. He thought about giving up, but then found a Ford pickup that would fit perfectly.\"I knew it could work. The dream had to come true. Success doesn't come one time. The full success of this is yet to come,\" he said. Twice, at different stages of development, an offer was made to buy the plane, but he refused, adamant that he would see it through.\"Mi a live my dream,\" he said before heading back to work on his machine.daviot.kelly@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7394, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f44fcab8ef622cb3", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:28.648", "title": "Servite Primary is all out of space", "occurred_at": "2012-08-13T03:18:09", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120813/lead/lead92.html", "data": "Carl Gilchrist, Gleaner WriterBROWN'S TOWN, St Ann:INSUFFICIENT FUNDS from the Government, coupled with tardiness from the Ministry of Education in helping to secure a building permit, have been blamed for the lack of sufficient space at Servite Primary School in Brown's Town, St Ann.Already, school officials have converted all available spaces on the compound into classrooms, including a section of the canteen and space underneath a stairway.And with demand for space at the school increasing, the school was forced to turn away 60 students from one school that was seeking admission for September 2012, according to principal, Elaine Crawford.With the school unable to build new classrooms as required, come September, the over 700 students on roll and the 20 teachers will return to the cramped spaces they have had to endure over the past few years.Crawford said the school, on its own, has gone ahead and secured a building plan for the construction of new classrooms. However, the Ministry of Education later provided a building plan of its own, for which approval is now being awaited from the parish council.Missing folio number\"Part of the requirement for the approval is that a title of the land or at least the folio number, along with five copies of the plan should be provided. So we are waiting on the ministry to provide those,\" Crawford said.The principal said $165,000 is also to be provided by the ministry to the council as fees.When contacted last Wednesday, building officer at the Ministry's Region Three office in Brown's Town, Delroy Clarke, said the Ministry of Education had provided a building plan for construction of a block of four classrooms, along with two sanitation areas. He said the hold-up in getting the approval was due to a delay in getting the title for the property from the authorities.In the meantime, Crawford explained that for the amount of things that need to be done, the money being allocated by the government is insufficient.\"We get $800,000 per year but we would need about two million dollars per year, especially with the way I run this school,\" Crawford told The Gleaner.\"For all the things you need to enhance literacy, especially as it relates to the math specialist and Health and Family Life Education (HFLE) for which we need practical sessions, we would need additional funds,\" she added.Vice-principal, Olga Chambers, who also teaches one of the three grade six classes, bemoaned the lack of space at the school. She highlighted a new toilet facility being built in time for September, which she said was well needed and was indeed a welcome addition. The new facility is being built under a stairway.Chambers highlighted some of the concerns.\"The space for grade one is limited. We have one of the grade one classes in the canteen, it's the canteen area that we have to part off to make a class and it's not conducive for the children. And that class can barely take maybe 35 students because it's not big.\"She continued: \"We have a grade one that is adequate for 40 students. But the third grade one is literally not healthy, not safe. It's a makeshift class room under the stairs, that was used to be a storeroom. It's one way in, one way out, it's about six feet wide, can't hold more than 12 students comfortably. So we need classrooms, we need space for grade one.\"\"The grade four classes are in the auditorium that we have partitioned. We have to take out the platform and make it into classrooms, we now have three class- rooms in that section,\" she said.Chambers said she was hoping the school would have been able to get at least two new classrooms for the last academic year but tardiness on the part of the ministry prevented this.\"Honestly that is the main concern right now. The children can't function so well in those narrow spaces that they are in, it's a sin,\" Chambers said.The need for furniture is less critical although Chambers showed The Gleaner a wooden chair that she has been using since 1983, which is repaired each time it falls apart.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7395, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c2b6eeb089cccfc5", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:29.120", "title": "Street sweepers cry", "occurred_at": "2012-08-13T03:18:09", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120812/lead/lead71.html", "data": "Some State-employed street sweepers are arguing that the $6,000 they take home each fortnight is not enough to cover their basic needs.The street sweepers, who hit the roads before the proverbial cock crows in the wee hours of the morning, are also disgruntled by what they claim is a discrepancy in the payment structure which sees some taking home more money than others.An aged street sweeper, who asked not to be named, told our news team that while some workers take home $6,000 per fortnight, others take home $11,000 despite everyone mandated to work a minimum of four hours each day.\"When me buy medication me nun have no money left,\" the street sweeper bemoaned.\"The whole ah we working in this.

All sweepers are paid in keeping with the minimum wage and for the total hours worked,\" she said.However, the NSWMA was not immediately able to say if any of its street sweepers work less than 40 hours per week and as a result are paid below the minimum wage of $4,500.When asked if the agency believes the current level of remuneration to street sweepers should be increased, Guthrie said: \"We believe that we can never adequately compensate our team members for the job that they do every day to keep the society free of disease.\"MandateThe NSWMA community relations manager also underscored the importance of the street sweepers to the authority's mandate.\"Part of our mandate is to maintain the general aesthetics of roads, verges, median strips and major parks through public cleansing activities which include sweeping. Our sweepers are not only essential to the day-to-day operations but contribute to our overall success.\"The contribution of the sweepers is evident daily when the average person traverses the streets and the streets are clean or not clean. Imagine downtown (Kingston) after one day if no sweeping takes place in the evening or early the next morning,\" said Guthrie.Come September the minimum wage will be increased to $5,000 so street sweepers should see an increase in their pay.tyrone.reid@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7396, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e67ea2ec135f091e", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:29.550", "title": "Building a better world", "occurred_at": "2012-08-13T03:18:09", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120812/lead/lead8.html", "data": "UNDP leads regional celebration of International Day of the YouthThe challenges and issues facing young people will be brought to the forefront today as the world marks International Day of the Youth.But, most of all, the enthusiasm and accomplishments of young people will be celebrated today.\"Building a better world, partnering with the youth\" is the theme of this year's celebration of a day about and for young people.The day will also be used to highlight the challenges which still face young people, such as high levels of unemployment, a lack of educational opportunities, and being marginalised from the decision-making process.The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the Caribbean, has, among others, answered the global call to action to develop and engage in partnerships with and for the youth, by creating Project Youth Innovation, also known as Youth-In.Youth-In has its genesis in a CARICOM 2010 Youth Commission report dubbed: 'Eye on the Future: Investing in youth now for Tomorrow's Community'.The report showed the challenges of Caribbean youth and the costs to Caribbean societies if there was no investment in youth.\"We are living in such incredibly momentous times, but young people can change the world for the better and they can do it their way once given a chance,\" said Michelle Gyles-McDonnough, UNDP Resident Representative.\"Youth should be given a chance to take an active part in the decision-making of local, national and global levels - and this the purpose of the Youth-In project - to empower young people to be active agents of change,\" added Gyles-McDonnough.The Youth-In project is multifaceted, giving young people in the region several platforms from which they can change the world in their own way.The project has five main 'corners' - arts and culture, volunteerism, the Youth-In Think Tank, entrepreneurship and participation.Each of these corners has several different projects that are intended to engage young Caribbean people in a variety of ways.Coming out of the arts and culture corner already this summer, was the Spice It Up Song contest.That competition attracted aspiring young singers and songwriters from Barbados and Grenada, who composed songs promoting disaster awareness and preparedness.Alternative meansAccording to the UNDP, the policy of allowing young people to \"talk through the arts\", is to demonstrate alternative means of disseminating information in ways that can easily be digested.Also out of Youth-In was the Youth Think Tank (YTT) of the Caribbean, which has also been in action this summer season, with three of the 14 specially selected members of the Think Tank journeying to Kingston, to participate in a Caribbean Regional Youth Leaders' Summit.The YTT for the Caribbean was launched on May 18, at the UN House in Barbados.It is one of the few think tanks in the world that have been created to give the young generation a voice and it is unique in its structure.The members of this group were chosen through an open competition launched earlier this year where 14 young people were selected from 98 applicants.Mario Rose is the representative from Jamaica on the Think Tank.While the Youth-In project has already been active across the region for several months, the spotlight will now be on the Youth-In web portal which will go live today.The website \"www.youth-in.com\" is a resource for young Caribbean people which has all of the information and news on the initiatives being pursued under the various corners and also highlights the accomplishments of positive Caribbean youth.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7397, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b6a28fe078552aec", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:29.998", "title": "Turning trash to cash", "occurred_at": "2012-08-13T03:18:09", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120812/lead/lead81.html", "data": "Daraine Luton, Senior Staff ReporterJunior Achievers earn Canadian trip after successfully operating small businessesHAVING SUCCESSFULLY operated companies in their schools and communities for six months, five of the country's brightest teenagers yesterday jetted off to Canada, where they will be further exposed to the rudiments of entrepreneurship.The students, who participated in a Junior Achievement Programme, will be further exposed to the art and craft of business on this trip.One of the participants, Stephan Smith, who recently graduated from Ardenne High School, is full of expectation, having been part of a team which successful ran Creating Accessories Naturally (CAN).He told The Sunday Gleaner that his team made good cash from picking up trash and turning them into fashion.\"We made jewellery, mostly for females, out of cans,\" said Smith.According to Smith, the decision to make jewellery from trash came after much market research.\"We went around and did a market research asking the students what product they would be interested in. Most of the students who participated said they wanted jewellery.\"We thought, what can we do to make this jewellery innovative? Surfing the Internet, we saw where bracelets were made out of cans,\" said Smith.He added: \"We all decided this was a good idea. Why not start a recycling project with a twist to it?\"We went around and we collected the different types of cans. For example, on our fun day, we collected a whole heap of soda cans, like three garbage bags full of soda cans. We cleaned them, filed them down, and we used the soda cans to make different kinds of earrings. Milk cans and other firmer cans we used to make bracelets.\"Profitable ventureAs dictated by the rules of the Junior Achievement Programme, the five students involved in CAP had to sell shares to raise start-up capital.The company raised $14,600 in start-up capital and at the end of six months when the business was liquidated, it recorded gross profit of $29,650.With the business turning out to be a successful venture, Smith believes the participants in the programme have benefited tremendously from the opportunity to make themselves into entrepreneurs.He also believes that programmes such as Junior Achievement could be instrumental in building Jamaica's productive sector.\"Jamaica has a lot of resources, it is just for us to find the ways and different means; how to market it, and how to present it in such a way that it can compete in the global market place,\" said Smith.Paul McFarlane, the marketing manager for Junior Achievement sought to underscore the importance of the entrepreneurship programme.\"It is not only for them to make money but also for them to learn skills in entrepreneurship, financial literacy and work readiness,\" said McFarlane.Wilfred Johnson, manager of Junior Achievement in western Jamaica, said the students who have jetted off to Canada were selected from a number of schools islandwide.\"We expect that the country will be more business minded once they get there. The forums or conferences are where they invite business leaders from around the world. They will have some good keynote speakers coming in to speak to the students about how to actually run their business and make it even more successful.\"The students will get exposure meeting business leaders overall and they can bring that back to Jamaica to share with their peers,\" said Johnson.The students will return to the island on August 18 .\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7398, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eaa7c9df70648e43", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:30.438", "title": "Gov't to rethink exam subsidy", "occurred_at": "2012-08-13T03:18:09", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120812/lead/lead9.html", "data": "WITH APPROXIMATELY 20 per cent of students failing to turn up for CSEC exams which were paid for by the taxpayers, Education Minister Ronald Thwaites is adamant that the time has come for a rethink of the way the subsidy is given.\"The Government of Jamaica as well as many other philanthropic (entities) pay for the entries of many, many students.

And, with two young kids, this was shaping up to be a nightmare of an experience. Suffice it to say, the staff of the ticket resolution office worked beyond the call of duty to change the ticketing locations and ultimately got them seats together that were literally in touching distance of the athletes.This was a logistical miracle, especially considering the fact that these tickets would have been sought after and purchased probably a year in advance of the Olympic Games.Their son, Brad, became an instant celebrity as after the race BBC TV focused on him as a way of portraying the thrill of the Jamaican fans.In another case at a nearby mall, a Jamaican fan misplaced his bag with a cluster of highly sought-after track and field tickets, his camera, as well as other personal items. Apparently, a good Samaritan realised it belonged to a Jamaican by scrolling through the camera shots. He then alerted a group of other Jamaican fans, who he identified by their colours, eventually leading to the return of the items to the distraught fan.Note clearly that the tickets cannot be replaced, and even if you could, the price tag makes the exercise prohibitive.As we continue to celebrate Jamaica 50 in London, our Caribbean neighbours have joined the party and the love and affection is spreading like wildfire.The Bahamian victory in the men's 4x400m on Friday led to spontaneous celebrations outside the Olympic Stadium and the Jamaican fan is always up for a good time.The athletes are performing, the fans are ecstatic and the local pub awaits the next group of Jamaicans to set the place alight.One love!\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7404, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/509a55afb9c0519e", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:33.120", "title": "OUTSTANDING!

Parchment lowered the 110m hurdles national record to 13.12 seconds and Weir completed a Jamaican sweep in the 200m behind Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake.\"So many [good performances] for Jamaica, Usain Bolt repeating, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce repeating, but perhaps other performances not just the winners [should also be celebrated] - third place in the 200m, third place in the 110m hurdles.

She didn't win a medal, but to us, her fourth place was as good as a medal,\" said Fennell.\"Samantha Albert also did well in a sport that is not well-known in Jamaica, but equestrian is a very big sport here as seen at the venues, fantastic crowds, and she rode well and was very competitive.\"What this says is that once we scratch the surface, there is no stopping us in any sport, but it is going to require serious investment and not just cheers when we win, but also in the development stage.

The Pet Shop Boys, Annie Lennox and Fatboy Slim will also be on hand to get people dancing.Tips and photos have emerged from the rehearsal venue, an old car plant in east London.The Spice Girls were photographed dancing atop black London taxis, so a rendition of their biggest hit, Wannabe, seems possible.So does an appearance by surviving members of Queen, whose We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions have been ever-present at the Games.And Ray Davies of The Kinks is tipped to perform his majestic London ballad Waterloo Sunset.Paul McCartney has already performed at the opening ceremony, but it's inconceivable that there won't be a bit of Beatles music in a tribute to the best of British pop.And organisers will want to include younger acts such as Tinie Tempah, Jessie J, Emeli Sande and the Kaiser Chiefs.'CHEEKY' REFLECTIONOrganisers have said they want the ceremony to be a \"cheeky\" reflection of modern Britain, so expect touches of Monty Pythonesque humour - perhaps even Python Eric Idle leading a mass rendition of Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.The show won't be short on spectacle. Director Kim Gavin has overseen tours for the band Take That and directed London's 2007 Princess Diana memorial concert. Designer Es Devlin has created sets for everyone from Lady Gaga to the Royal Opera.As with director Danny Boyle's opening ceremony, London is aiming for a plucky, irreverent tone far removed from Beijing's 2008 Olympic closer, which was heavy on precision displays of fireworks, acrobatics and dancing.\"It's not anything desperately profound,\" London Games chief Sebastian Coe said. \"It's not the opening ceremony, but I think it will be great.

They ran well and got our old record ... and I commend them, and I am glad their stick came around \u0085 we showed them that we can run 36 seconds, but those guys aren't ready for it,\" said a smiling Blake, who in truth had a 'beastly' third leg against American Tyson Gay, who he says he enjoys running against.\"I love to run with Tyson Gay. He always pushes me. When I saw him, I said, 'Look, yuh dead',\" Blake joked, referring to his determination to get the better of the American.\"I know he was shaking when he saw me on his leg, but again they ran pretty well also and we have to commend them.\"Like his teammates, Bolt said he was never worried about the Americans and that it was just a matter or how fast he and his teammates would run.\"It was not a shock. It was really about how fast we could actually run and we hadn't had the cleanest baton changes, but I am happy we came out here and got the record and the win,\" said Bolt.\"It was never a worry. I have heard them talk, but it was never a worry because we know what we are capable of. Yohan has stepped up, I have stepped up, Michael Frater and Nesta Carter are very fast, so there was never any worry for me,\" said Bolt.This was Jamaica's third Olympic medal in the men's 4x100m and their second gold.Jamaica also won a bronze medal in the women's 4x400m in 3:20.95 yesterday behind the US, 3:16.87 and Russia, 3:20.23. \n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7410, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aad19bafb7c45af0", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:36.072", "title": "Sensational talents from Trelawny", "occurred_at": "2012-08-13T03:18:09", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120812/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Paulton Gordon, Sunday Gleaner WriterThe Olympic Games are winding down, but the warmth of the host has remained at a constant high throughout the entire event.A consistent view is that the outpouring of love for Jamaican fans has been overwhelming, resulting in a positive Olympic experience.Could this be linked to the excellent track and field results or is it related to the swagger and aura that is emitted when we are in the house?Whatever it is, the view is that the volunteers, tour guides, store assistants - and Londoners, in general - are showing a distinct bias to those from the land of the hummingbird.Ticketing dilemmaThe support and assistance rendered to Jamaican fans have been excellent.A case in point is the lengths to which the staff of the ticket resolution office went to sort out the ticketing dilemma of Dr Glen Strachan and his family.On the night of the men's 200m final, his four tickets were basically in different locations. And, with two young kids, this was shaping up to be a nightmare of an experience. Suffice it to say, the staff of the ticket resolution office worked beyond the call of duty to change the ticketing locations and ultimately got them seats together that were literally in touching distance of the athletes.This was a logistical miracle, especially considering the fact that these tickets would have been sought after and purchased probably a year in advance of the Olympic Games.Their son, Brad, became an instant celebrity as after the race BBC TV focused on him as a way of portraying the thrill of the Jamaican fans.In another case at a nearby mall, a Jamaican fan misplaced his bag with a cluster of highly sought-after track and field tickets, his camera, as well as other personal items. Apparently, a good Samaritan realised it belonged to a Jamaican by scrolling through the camera shots. He then alerted a group of other Jamaican fans, who he identified by their colours, eventually leading to the return of the items to the distraught fan.Note clearly that the tickets cannot be replaced, and even if you could, the price tag makes the exercise prohibitive.As we continue to celebrate Jamaica 50 in London, our Caribbean neighbours have joined the party and the love and affection is spreading like wildfire.The Bahamian victory in the men's 4x400m on Friday led to spontaneous celebrations outside the Olympic Stadium and the Jamaican fan is always up for a good time.The athletes are performing, the fans are ecstatic and the local pub awaits the next group of Jamaicans to set the place alight.One love!\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7411, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9687fcf601b0a93e", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:36.511", "title": "Future is bright in sprinting, says Watts", "occurred_at": "2012-08-13T03:18:09", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120812/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Andr\u00e9 Lowe, Senior Staff ReporterLONDON, England:President of the Jamaica Olympic Association Mike Fennell has hailed the performances of the Jamaicans at the London Olympic Games and said there are possibilities for a sporting partnership between Jamaica and England in the future.Fennell, who was in the stands at the Excel London Exhibition Centre as Kenneth Edwards became the first Jamaican representative in the Olympic tae kwon do competition, made particular mention of those who competed admirably in areas outside of track and field, including swimmer Alia Atkinson, equestrienne Samantha Albert, and Edwards, who all impressed during the Games.\"Things have gone extremely well,\" Fennell told The Sunday Gleaner.\"I know people had some wild expectations and others had more reasonable ones, but they have lived up to their expectations in every way.

Parchment lowered the 110m hurdles national record to 13.12 seconds and Weir completed a Jamaican sweep in the 200m behind Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake.\"So many [good performances] for Jamaica, Usain Bolt repeating, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce repeating, but perhaps other performances not just the winners [should also be celebrated] - third place in the 200m, third place in the 110m hurdles.

Unfortunately, it was overcome by developments in bauxite, among other things. You see what is currently happening with (the closure of some bauxite companies); everybody now has to fall back on agriculture,\" the minister pointed out.challengesHighlighting the increased number of young people currently engaged in the sector, Clarke said this \"augurs well\" for the industry's future, and suggested that the challenges in the sector are not insurmountable.\"We must find a way to ensure that we eat what we grow and grow what we eat. This is something that has been spoken of for nearly 40 years. Therefore, we have to step up to the plate and make sure that we move head on to deal with that situation,\" he said.To this end, Minister Clarke emphasised the need for special focus on areas in which the country has competitive advantage, in addition to product packaging, presentation and pricing.Citing his recent visit to London, England, to analyse the market there, \"to see what we could capitalise on,\" Clarke said he was informed by stakeholders that crops, such as yam and pumpkin, were being imported from other countries, at a more competitive price than what obtains locally.\"Competition is the order of the day. Even the presentation of our products is also critical. The presentation of the things we produce must look so attractive that people want to buy it,\" the minister said, while urging greater effort in pursuits that will boost the sector's fortunes locally and globally.partnershipThe MAJIC is a United States Agency for International Development-funded project which was jointly implemented by the agriculture ministry and the Agricultural Co-operative Development International/ Volunteers in Overseas Co-operative Assistance (ACDI/VOCA), a US-based private, international development non-profit organisation.MAJIC's project activities were designed, in partnership with the ministry, to assist Jamaica's agricultural sector to become a more market-driven, profitable, and competitive industry, contributing significantly to economic and social growth in rural communities.The project pioneered the expanded use of the Farmer Field School methodology to enhance farmer knowledge and best-practice adoption in Jamaica, with emphasis on demonstrations in solving problems with the growing cycle of field crops.Last Wednesday's graduation was the third and concluding leg in the series, which saw over 60 farmers graduating, having completed the training course delivered by the ACDI/VOCA technical team over 20 weeks.- Contributed by Douglas McIntosh, Jamaica Information ServiceFull Caption: Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Roger Clarke (left) presents Farmer Field School graduate Cheryl Binns with her certificate during last Wednesday's graduation ceremony for participants in the United States Agency for International Development-funded Marketing and Agriculture for Jamaican Improved Competitiveness project training course at the Bridge Palm Hotel in Clarendon.

They desperately wanted him to have a strong performance to disprove what they perceived to be lies by the Romney campaign about his intentions for the middle class if he were to be re-elected.Governor Romney's supporters simply wanted him to have another strong performance to continue the momentum he gained from the first debate. The issues for which many students were seeking clarification from both candidates included: who could work best with members of Congress to get things done in Washington; who would be more clear in their explanation of their plan for the future and, most important, who could reassure them that after college, they would end up getting a well-paying job.international delegates As students and participants settled into their seats, the representative from the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) reminded everyone, including the moderator, to turn off all cellphones. Everyone was asked not to applaud or disagree with the candidates during the debate so that the focus would remain on the candidates and not the audience. Welcome was extended to the approximately 30 international delegates which included Gary Allen, managing director of Jamaica's RJR Group, who were guests of the CPD to not only witness the debate, but to get a first-hand view of what it takes to put on such a production. This included the rules around sponsorship and being a neutral party in ensuring that all the candidates and their parties are equally represented.For many students, the most dramatic moment was when Obama responded to Governor Romney's claim that the administration was possibly deliberately misleading the American people in not being forthright about the events in Libya which led to the death of an American ambassador and three other American citizens. The president's commanding response in staring down his opponent when he vehemently denied that anyone in his administration would do such a thing and that he himself found the allegations \"offensive\", was, to them, a turning point in the debate.The impact of these debates will be seen on November 16 when Americans go to the polls to elect their next president, but it was clear that Obama and Romney supporters felt that their candidate of choice handled themselves well. Many undecided voters were still left feeling that they did not get answers to the questions that could sway their decision one way or the other. The lack of detail by both candidates about their plan for the future is still making the decision difficult. For some, Romney appeared to outdo the president in terms of his economic record in his home state of Massa-chusetts, while Obama was the clear winner when referencing foreign policy.

decadesIt was no easy going for the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) as its workers trudged from household to household in townships and villages to garner data that has formed the 2011 Population and Housing Census that will serve to guide Jamaica in the years ahead.Crime and violence, raging hostilities from some ordinary Jamaicans, a fierce tussle with census takers and even attacks from some animals conspired to make the April to August 2011 exercise a particularly challenging endeavour for STATIN.For Dr Valerie Nam, STATIN's director, censuses, demographics and social statistics, the 2011 census foray was the most frustrating that she had encountered in all her 44 years in the field.Director General of STATIN Sonia Jackson disclosed that the census takers were hampered by the spectre of crime and violence in some areas.\"Crime and violence prevented the data from being collected at nights,\" revealed Jackson of the exercise which cost the Government $1.58 billion over a three-year period.Apart from the age-old challenge of resistance to the census takers, Nam told yesterday's launch of the census data that brand new obstacles surfaced.Nam said chief among the challenges was a tussle with census takers, who took strike action and slowed the process.Declaring that the exercise was the most disappointing for her, the veteran statistician complained that many census takers were driven  solely by money.\"We were expected to pay for what we did not see,\" Nam asserted. \"There was the frustration in collecting the data, and while we are accustomed to fighting with the public, I am not accustomed to a service with the underpinning not for service, all for money.\"Nam conceded that the process of assessing the work took time, a reality to which the workers failed to appreciate.\"It is the most contentious combative relationship that I have encountered,\" she declared.&lt;object id=\"flashObj\" width=\"280\" height=\"270\"

PROCESSIn addition to her assertion that the crime and violence in some communities hampered the exercise, Jackson said the proliferation of gated communities, intended to keep out hoodlums, also created its own forms of challenges for her team.Jackson also disclosed that some of the workers were attacked by dogs.\"Barriers were erected in spite of the very good public education programme that existed,\" she said. \"Generally, the populace was aware.\"Horace Dalley, minister without portfolio in the Ministry of Finance, also noted that the failure of STATIN to pay incentives resulted in an unfortunate industrial action, which was evident in his Northern Clarendon constituency.Dalley lamented that given the invaluable service being offered by STATIN, the entity should not be subject to any shortage of financial resources.\"That should not be so,\" he declared.Dalley also acknowledged that the census takers were subjected to hostilities from some Jamaicans who feared that the information would be forwarded to the tax authorities.\"We will have to reach a stage when all of us must accept that we have to share in the tax burden,\" he argued.However, he was quick to stress that at this point, the data garnered in the census exercise are not shared with other government entities.gary.spaulding@gleanerjm.com2.69 - Million people living in Jamaica in 2011\n&#13;\n

baby boom in Jamaica over the past 10 years.In fact, the reality is quite the opposite. Not surprisingly, the decline in births has triggered a marginal increase in Jamaica's population between 2001, when the penultimate census was taken, and 2011.The figures would suggest that years of urging by the authorities that spawned the maxim 'two is better than too many', among other birth control public-education messages, has sunk into the psyche of young Jamaicans - at least in some quarters of society.The Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) revealed yesterday in its census findings that fewer than 500,000 babies were added to the Jamaica population over the past decade, falling from an average of 24.2 per 1,000 between 1991 and 2001 to 17.4 per 1,000 between 2001 and 2011.In its own words, STATIN attributed the low growth rates to \"declining numbers of births\".The figures are contained in the 2011 Population and Housing Census, launched yesterday, which revealed that the population is still less than 2.7 million.In fact, the precise population figure is 2.678 million, an obvious surprise to some, but not to STATIN officials who had been monitoring the data.Some Jamaicans had expressed belief that it was higher. This represents a mere 3.5 per cent increase in the nearly 10 years since the 2001 census, which indicated a population of 2.607 million. The 2011 population figure represents an annual growth rate of 0.36 per cent since 2001.STATIN's director of censuses, demographic and social statistic, Dr Valerie Nam, attributed the slow growth rate to a significant downward trajectory of the birth rate.This was reflected in the census data which indicated that population changes must be interpreted within the context of the three components of population change - births, deaths and migration.&lt;object id=\"flashObj\" width=\"280\" height=\"270\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,47,0\"&gt;&lt;param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;isUI=1\" /&gt;&lt;param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" /&gt;&lt;param name=\"flashVars\" value=\"videoId=1908461688001&amp;playerID=1705915030001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAABQayB7RE~,DM_EXNxOEOc2W0Hzexc-reSESk3DVhCF&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true\" /&gt;&lt;param name=\"base\" value=\"http://admin.brightcove.com\" /&gt;&lt;param name=\"seamlesstabbing\" value=\"false\" /&gt;&lt;param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /&gt;&lt;param name=\"swLiveConnect\" value=\"true\" /&gt;&lt;param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /&gt;&lt;embed src=\"http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;isUI=1\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" flashVars=\"videoId=1908461688001&amp;playerID=1705915030001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAABQayB7RE~,DM_EXNxOEOc2W0Hzexc-reSESk3DVhCF&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true\" base=\"http://admin.brightcove.com\" name=\"flashObj\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" seamlesstabbing=\"false\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" swLiveConnect=\"true\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash\"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;MIGRANTS HARD TO NUMBERNam noted that the figures on births and deaths were not hard to come by - not so for those on migration.Between 2001 and 2011, 438,318 babies were added to the local population which lost nearly 347,967 persons to death or migration.The figures also reflect a marginal increase in the death rate, from 6.4 per 1,000 in 1991 to 7.1 in 2001.STATIN found that the difference in the population from natural increase (difference between births and deaths) was 259,065 over the decade.\"The very low growth rate of 0.356 per cent was only the second time since census taking began in Jamaica in the late 19th century that the rates have been so low,\" the report stated. \"The previous period was between 1911 and 1921 and the low rate at that time attributable to the high levels of migration.\"gary.spaulding@gleanerjm.comPopulation growth slows due to low rate of birthsChange in parish population over 10 years\\\u00a0Parish\u00a02001\u00a02011\u00a0Kingston\u00a096,052\u00a089,057\u00a0St Andrew\u00a0555,828\u00a0573,369\u00a0St Thomas\u00a091,604\u00a093,902\u00a0Portland\u00a080,205\u00a081,744\u00a0St Mary\u00a0111,466\u00a0113,615\u00a0St Ann\u00a0166,762\u00a0172,362\u00a0Trelawny\u00a073,066\u00a075,164\u00a0St James\u00a0175,127\u00a0183,811\u00a0Hanover\u00a067,037\u00a069,533\u00a0Westmoreland\u00a0138,948\u00a0144,103\u00a0St Elizabeth\u00a0146,404\u00a0150,205\u00a0Manchester\u00a0185,801\u00a0189,797\u00a0Clarendon\u00a0237,024\u00a0245,103\u00a0St Catherine\u00a0482,308\u00a0516,218Babies Born \u00a0Census year\u00a0Number\u00a01911\u00a0370,2001943\u00a0765,300\u00a01960\u00a0855,500\u00a01970\u00a0676,500\u00a01982\u00a0747,788\u00a01991\u00a0505,844\u00a02001\u00a0603,090\u00a02011\u00a0438,318How we have grown since 1911\u00a0Census year\u00a0Population\u00a01911\u00a0831,383\u00a01921\u00a0858,118\u00a01943\u00a01,237,063\u00a01960\u00a01,609,814\u00a01970\u00a01,848,512\u00a01982\u00a02,190,357\u00a01991\u00a02,380,666\u00a02001\u00a02,607,632\u00a02011\u00a02,697,983\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7420, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7732e600aca37ea3", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:44.848", "title": "'Staying away from math will affect us'", "occurred_at": "2012-10-18T06:45:03", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121018/lead/lead3.html", "data": "STATIN has problems finding statisticiansNadisha Hunter, Staff ReporterThe general deficiency that the country continues to face in mathematics, which is sometimes due to a fear for the subject by some students, could soon have a negative impact on the supply of data by the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN).The disclosure came yesterday during a Gleaner Editors' Forum at the newspaper's North Street, central Kingston, head offices.STATIN Director General Sonia Jackson said it was a critical issue which could affect the long-term sustainability of the entity.\"Staying away from mathematics is going to affect us even in the supply of our statisticians because that is becoming a regional issue.

The Chancery of the Orders of Societies of Honour (in the Office of the Prime Minister) runs the National Honours and Awards programme. Every year, between January and March, the Chancery invites the public to nominate persons in the eight honours and awards categories.Nomination forms are available at the Office of the Chancery, ministries, departments and agencies of government; Jamaican missions overseas and, being the 21st century, also online. An eight-member selection committee (whose identities are very hush-hush), then shortlists the public's nominees. That shortlist is then reviewed by the prime minister, who then presents the nominees to the wider Cabinet for approval. Finally, the list goes to the governor general for assent. Got it?

The team has won for five years straight and it has been a good season and I'm looking forward to at least two more years of good things to come. I have always wanted to represent my country and I always try my best in whatever I do.Roger Clarke (contribution to politics)I have given nothing but my best over the years. I have been in representational politics for 26 years and I try to be as level-headed as possible, I try to live well with my colleagues on both sides of the political fence and I'm indeed delighted. Growing up in a little district and being able to accomplish this is good. I have made my contribution and the love that I have received from the two constituencies that I have served is overwhelming. My family, especially my wife, has been very supportive and that's what keeps me going. I just want to continue doing my best, it gets emotional sometimes but I love my country and I want to continue doing my best. \n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7422, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/36e1d56187ffc758", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:45.810", "title": "McNeill, Crawford to take part in Digicel Run/Walk", "occurred_at": "2012-10-18T06:45:03", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121018/lead/lead5.html", "data": "As Kingstonians and other sporting enthusiasts count down to the October 20 Digicel Foundation 5K Night Run/Walk, the Jamaica Tourist Board (JTB) has joined public- and private-sector organisations in supporting the groundbreaking event.In addition, both Tourism Minister Wykeham McNeill and his state minister, Damion Crawford, will take part in the race.

Their sentences were reserved until yesterday.For her part, Regisford had told the court that she was unaware that the child was being kidnapped when he was taken away from the school and transported to Manchester, where he was subsequently rescued by the police and reunited with his family.The original charges stemmed from the abduction of the child on the afternoon May 3, 2011. He was reportedly taken while waiting to be picked up by his parents.CHANGE OF PLEASIn the aftermath of the child's rescue, the four accused were arrested and charged. Initially, all four had pleaded not guilty, but subsequently, Tomlinson, Mitchell and the juvenile changed their pleas to guilty of child-stealing.Under local law, the maximum sentence for kidnapping is life imprisonment, whereas child-stealing carries a maximum sentence of seven years' imprisonment.Lead prosecutor Jeremy Taylor, in recounting the facts of the case to the court, noted that Mitchell had previously been employed by the child's father.Despite having his pastor Ewen Granville, of the Mt Zion House of Israel, giving character evidence on his behalf, Mitchell got just one year short of the maximum sentence of seven years.\"The maximum sentence is seven years and you are not getting less than six,\" High Court judge Martin Gayle told Mitchell in passing sentence on

Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) as its workers trudged from household to household in townships and villages to garner data that has formed the 2011 Population and Housing Census that will serve to guide Jamaica in the years ahead.Crime and violence, raging hostilities from some ordinary Jamaicans, a fierce tussle with census takers and even attacks from some animals conspired to make the April to August 2011 exercise a particularly challenging endeavour for STATIN.For Dr Valerie Nam, STATIN's director, censuses, demographics and social statistics, the 2011 census foray was the most frustrating that she had encountered in all her 44 years in the field.Director General of STATIN Sonia Jackson disclosed that the census takers were hampered by the spectre of crime and violence in some areas.\"Crime and violence prevented the data from being collected at nights,\" revealed Jackson of the exercise which cost the Government $1.58 billion over a three-year period.Apart from the age-old challenge of resistance to the census takers, Nam told yesterday's launch of the census data that brand new obstacles surfaced.Nam said chief among the challenges was a tussle with census takers, who took strike action and slowed the process.Declaring that the exercise was the most disappointing for her, the veteran statistician complained that many census takers were driven  solely by money.\"We were expected to pay for what we did not see,\" Nam asserted. \"There was the frustration in collecting the data, and while we are accustomed to fighting with the public, I am not accustomed to a service with the underpinning not for service, all for money.\"Nam conceded that the process of assessing the work took time, a reality to which the workers failed to appreciate.\"It is the most contentious combative relationship that I have encountered,\" she declared.&lt;object id=\"flashObj\" width=\"280\" height=\"270\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"

PROCESSIn addition to her assertion that the crime and violence in some communities hampered the exercise, Jackson said the proliferation of gated communities, intended to keep out hoodlums, also created its own forms of challenges for her team.Jackson also disclosed that some of the workers were attacked by dogs.\"Barriers were erected in spite of the very good public education programme that existed,\" she said. \"Generally, the populace was aware.\"Horace Dalley, minister without portfolio in the Ministry of Finance, also noted that the failure of STATIN to pay incentives resulted in an unfortunate industrial action, which was evident in his Northern Clarendon constituency.Dalley lamented that given the invaluable service being offered by STATIN, the entity should not be subject to any shortage of financial resources.\"That should not be so,\" he declared.Dalley also acknowledged that the census takers were subjected to hostilities from some Jamaicans who feared that the information would be forwarded to the tax authorities.\"We will have to reach a stage when all of us must accept that we have to share in the tax burden,\" he argued.However, he was quick to stress that at this point, the data garnered in the census exercise are not shared with other government entities.gary.spaulding@gleanerjm.com2.69 - Million people living in Jamaica in 2011\n&#13;\n

been no baby boom in Jamaica over the past 10 years.In fact, the reality is quite the opposite. Not surprisingly, the decline in births has triggered a marginal increase in Jamaica's population between 2001, when the penultimate census was taken, and 2011.The figures would suggest that years of urging by the authorities that spawned the maxim 'two is better than too many', among other birth control public-education messages, has sunk into the psyche of young Jamaicans - at least in some quarters of society.The Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) revealed yesterday in its census findings that fewer than 500,000 babies were added to the Jamaica population over the past decade, falling from an average of 24.2 per 1,000 between 1991 and 2001 to 17.4 per 1,000 between 2001 and 2011.In its own words, STATIN attributed the low growth rates to \"declining numbers of births\".The figures are contained in the 2011 Population and Housing Census, launched yesterday, which revealed that the population is still less than 2.7 million.In fact, the precise population figure is 2.678 million, an obvious surprise to some, but not to STATIN officials who had been monitoring the data.Some Jamaicans had expressed belief that it was higher. This represents a mere 3.5 per cent increase in the nearly 10 years since the 2001 census, which indicated a population of 2.607 million. The 2011 population figure represents an annual growth rate of 0.36 per cent since 2001.STATIN's director of censuses, demographic and social statistic, Dr Valerie Nam, attributed the slow growth rate to a significant downward trajectory of the birth rate.This was reflected in the census data which indicated that population changes must be interpreted within the context of the three components of population change - births, deaths and migration.&lt;object id=\"flashObj\" width=\"280\" height=\"270\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,47,0\"&gt;&lt;param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;isUI=1\" /&gt;&lt;param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" /&gt;&lt;param name=\"flashVars\" value=\"videoId=1908461688001&amp;playerID=1705915030001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAABQayB7RE~,DM_EXNxOEOc2W0Hzexc-reSESk3DVhCF&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true\" /&gt;&lt;param name=\"base\" value=\"http://admin.brightcove.com\" /&gt;&lt;param name=\"seamlesstabbing\" value=\"false\" /&gt;&lt;param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /&gt;&lt;param name=\"swLiveConnect\" value=\"true\" /&gt;&lt;param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /&gt;&lt;embed src=\"http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;isUI=1\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" flashVars=\"videoId=1908461688001&amp;playerID=1705915030001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAABQayB7RE~,DM_EXNxOEOc2W0Hzexc-reSESk3DVhCF&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true\" base=\"http://admin.brightcove.com\" name=\"flashObj\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" seamlesstabbing=\"false\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" swLiveConnect=\"true\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash\"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;MIGRANTS HARD TO NUMBERNam noted that the figures on births and deaths were not hard to come by - not so for those on migration.Between 2001 and 2011, 438,318 babies were added to the local population which lost nearly 347,967 persons to death or migration.The figures also reflect a marginal increase in the death rate, from 6.4 per 1,000 in 1991 to 7.1 in 2001.STATIN found that the difference in the population from natural increase (difference between births and deaths) was 259,065 over the decade.\"The very low growth rate of 0.356 per cent was only the second time since census taking began in Jamaica in the late 19th century that the rates have been so low,\" the report stated. \"The previous period was between 1911 and 1921 and the low rate at that time attributable to the high levels of migration.\"gary.spaulding@gleanerjm.comPopulation growth slows due to low rate of birthsChange in parish population over 10 years\\\u00a0Parish\u00a02001\u00a02011\u00a0Kingston\u00a096,052\u00a089,057\u00a0St Andrew\u00a0555,828\u00a0573,369\u00a0St Thomas\u00a091,604\u00a093,902\u00a0Portland\u00a080,205\u00a081,744\u00a0St Mary\u00a0111,466\u00a0113,615\u00a0St Ann\u00a0166,762\u00a0172,362\u00a0Trelawny\u00a073,066\u00a075,164\u00a0St James\u00a0175,127\u00a0183,811\u00a0Hanover\u00a067,037\u00a069,533\u00a0Westmoreland\u00a0138,948\u00a0144,103\u00a0St Elizabeth\u00a0146,404\u00a0150,205\u00a0Manchester\u00a0185,801\u00a0189,797\u00a0Clarendon\u00a0237,024\u00a0245,103\u00a0St Catherine\u00a0482,308\u00a0516,218Babies Born \u00a0Census year\u00a0Number\u00a01911\u00a0370,2001943\u00a0765,300\u00a01960\u00a0855,500\u00a01970\u00a0676,500\u00a01982\u00a0747,788\u00a01991\u00a0505,844\u00a02001\u00a0603,090\u00a02011\u00a0438,318How we have grown since 1911\u00a0Census year\u00a0Population\u00a01911\u00a0831,383\u00a01921\u00a0858,118\u00a01943\u00a01,237,063\u00a01960\u00a01,609,814\u00a01970\u00a01,848,512\u00a01982\u00a02,190,357\u00a01991\u00a02,380,666\u00a02001\u00a02,607,632\u00a02011\u00a02,697,983\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7427, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f7e0d4004aca17b1", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:48.089", "title": "Dispute Resolution handbook now available", "occurred_at": "2012-10-18T06:45:03", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121018/lead/lead3.html", "data": "STATIN has problems finding statisticiansNadisha Hunter, Staff ReporterThe general deficiency that the country continues to face in mathematics, which is sometimes due to a fear for the subject by some students, could soon have a negative impact on the supply of data by the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN).The disclosure came yesterday during a Gleaner Editors' Forum at the newspaper's North Street, central Kingston, head offices.STATIN Director General Sonia Jackson said it was a critical issue which could affect the long-term sustainability of the entity.\"Staying away from mathematics is going to affect us even in the supply of our statisticians because that is becoming a regional issue.

The treatment will cost approximately US$10,000 (approximately J$900,000) and takes into account other expenses such as visa, transport, room and other miscellaneous costs.According to senior medical officer at the Kingston Public Hospital, Patrick Bhoorasingh: \"Tinnitus is an intractable condition. It is a ringing, a high-pitched ringing, swishing or other type of noise that appears to originate in the ear, as if something is wrong with the person's hearing mechanism. It can also originate in the brain.\"On rare occasions, this condition can represent a serious health condition for an individual.Marrah, who spent two years in prison in Trinidad and Tobago before arriving in Jamaica and meeting Clover Graham, the now deceased university lecturer, attorney-at-law and United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) honorary liaison in Jamaica, with whom he developed a close relationship, recalls developing the ailment almost two years ago.In his thick accent, he explained: \"It started in November. It started on the left. It is truly worse and it sounded like a cricket sound. I went to the school nurse and she prescribed some medication for me but it became worse. I can't hear now because it has spread to the left side.\"hearing aid doesn't helpHe further stated that he has been to a hospital and was given a hearing aid, but the device, which amplifies sound waves, compounded the situation. He noted that nothing done locally seemed to help.It was then he said his relationship with Graham blossomed to the point where he began referring to her as 'mom'. Graham worked alongside UNHCR deputy director for refugees in Washington and the Caribbean, Dr Buti Kale, to garner help locally and internationally for Marrah's condition. Graham helped with the preparation of letters seeking sponsorship from local entities, some to no avail. Eventually, she discovered the University of Antwerp in Belgium which had knowledge of his condition and ways of dealing with it. Correspondence began and doctors agreed to help but then tragedy struck and Graham was killed.Marrah now relies more on his college and Christiana Cunningham, also of the college, for help and support.Cunningham said that whenever Marrah is anxious or stressed, his hearing condition becomes worsened, which makes it difficult for him to focus, learn and play the music which he enjoys.Marrah has performed at Redbones, the University of Technology, Edna Manley and elsewhere. He has also spoken to prisoners at Tower Street about his life in Sierra Leone.Donations can be made to the Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts, NCB account number 211-448-482 at 2 Oxford Road or by calling Christiana Cunningham at 920-7400 or the college at 754-8830. \n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7430, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a95cdfec4bbeddd7", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:50.498", "title": "Graduates Foundation awards scholarships to inner-city youths", "occurred_at": "2012-10-17T07:00:39", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121017/lead/lead91.html", "data": "Three students from Tivoli Comprehensive High School who performed exceptionally well in their Caribbean Examinations Council exams have been awarded scholarships totalling $300,000 by The Graduates Foundation - a not-for-profit organisation of young professionals who tutor students from inner-city areas for free.This year's scholarship winners are King Wellington, now enrolled at Jamaica College sixth form (a long-standing partner of the foundation) and Shadine Gordon and Chevan Hussey, both of whom are now at Excelsior Community College.

Persons who do not hold green cards may also be subject to the Act, if they travel to the US for at least two months each year.\"Since the announcement by the US of the enactment of FATCA, the CAB has been very concerned about the implications for financial services institutions in the Caribbean and the resultant impact on the economies of the region as a whole,\" noted Barclay.Additionally, Barclay told the chamber members that FATCA will be one of the key topics for discussion at CAB's upcoming 39th annual conference in Montego Bay. A legal team from the US is slated to be in attendance to assist in explaining the requirements of the Act.\"We'll be making suggestions as to how we should be dealing with the Act, and not just from a compliance point of view because, as I understand it, some of the requirements, if you comply with them, it would mean you'd be breaking the local laws,\" Barclay said.\"Whilst I have not heard much about it, I think this is something we ought to deal with, and this is one of the areas that will be dealt with extensively at the conference,\" added Barclay.CAB is a community of locally incorporated banks and other financial institutions from within the Caribbean, possessing a combined US$31 billion in assets as of 2010.christopher.thomas@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7434, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d9519f24ef9ee21c", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:46:57.287", "title": "Reggae Boyz's dream lives on!", "occurred_at": "2012-10-17T07:00:39", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121017/lead/lead1.html", "data": "Jamaica defeat Antigua 4-1 to advance to final round of World Cup 2014 qualifiers Jamaica's Reggae Boyz kept their hopes of advancing to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil alive following a 4-1 win over Antigua and Barbuda at the National Stadium last night.Two goals from striker Dane Richards and one each from Demar Phillips and defender Nyron Nosworthy rescued the national team from a previously precarious position.

Not even the first hit I can't recall ... . I can't tell you what that felt like.\"However, she said some of her students have described to her how she was punched to the ground, kicked repeatedly and left bloodied on the floor of the classroom.Still traumatisedThe primary school teacher said she remains traumatised by the incident and denied assaulting any of her students.\"The police have done a thorough investigation and they have said there is nothing to back that up,\" she said in reference to any suggestion that the attack was a reprisal for her assault on a student.On the contrary, the teacher said she believed the assault stemmed from \"some issues\" that had developed several days earlier.The teacher was also angry that, according to her, no one from the Ministry of Education has sought to contact her more than two weeks since the incident.\"No one has contacted me to find out what happened ... . 'Is it true? Why did you do this? Why did you not do that?'

That cannot work and they can't have their children running around the market and riding bicycles,\" he said.Jamaica not mentionedQuoting from a survey commissioned by the Florida Caribbean Cruise Association, Tulloch indicated that US$2 billion was spent in purchasing gifts in the Caribbean and Latin America but Jamaica was not mentioned.\"It was Bahamas that headed the list with the most purchases and Jamaica was not even mentioned. We have to look at our own product as it relates to what is offered as gifts.\"Tulloch also advocated for more qualified Jamaicans to be given the top jobs in the hotels and other tourism-related fields as opposed to the mass recruitment of expatriates.\"When hotels are built in Jamaica, it is time that we ensure that qualified Jamaicans get a place in those hotels. It is very, very difficult to see work permits are granted to people whose jobs Jamaicans could do.

I had to argue a lot and make people understand that these two regions have a lot of similarities.\"While some similar characteristics such as being surrounded by water are obvious, the islands are also bound together by rising food-import bills and declining agricultural populations - including farmers, agricultural technicians, managers and researchers. These are factors which make both regions susceptible to external economic and climatic shocks.Working to find solutionsNoting that even with limited resources these countries had been working to find solutions to their individual problems, Fonseca said the time has come to use ICT to bridge the communication divide and share the information and knowledge among countries within the Caribbean, as well as with their Pacific neighbours.\"Some of the solutions are well known but why are these people (within the region) not working with each other to learn from each other? You don't use the potential of ICT to collaborate, not because you don't want to but because you don't know what the other has to offer. It's the same in the Pacific,\" he charged.On the way going forward, Fonseca told The Gleaner: \"You have computer-based technologies here, web-based, email, Skype which can help people surmount the difficulties of distance. You have young people who can use these applications easily, so there is no use in saying that physical distance is anymore a barrier. Distance is less important than it used to be because of the new and emerging information and communications technologies.\"While acknowledging that there is still a place for face-to-face meetings in order to build trust and form long-term partnerships, he insisted that new and emerging information and communications technologies make distance less of an excuse for the lack of cooperation between Caribbean and Pacific people.\"Once you become aware of what they are doing there in terms of solutions to problems which are similar to yours, you start communicating, start sharing and finding solutions together,\" he said.Meanwhile Sergio Garcia, coordinator for the CARICOM Secretariat, is confident that the project for which the contribution agreement is due to be signed in November, allowing for allocation of the first tranche, will have more of an impact at the ground level, benefiting farmers more directly than other similar projects.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7445, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/727a64e06600bfcd", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:02.279", "title": "Traffic changes for WC qualifier", "occurred_at": "2012-10-17T07:00:39", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121016/lead/lead81.html", "data": "The police are advising supporters who will be attending the World Cup football qualifier between Jamaica and Antigua and Barbuda at 6:15 p.m. today that no firearms, knives, drugs, ice picks, machetes, glass bottles or any other items that can be used to cause serious harm or injury will be allowed inside the venue.Licensed firearm holders are being advised to make arrangements to leave their firearms for safekeeping with their local police.The following traffic changes will take effect approximately 5 p.m.: Arthur Wint Drive\u0095 Arthur Wint Drive, from its junction with North Avenue, will be used as a 'one way' with the two lanes allowing traffic to proceed towards the National Stadium.\u0095 Motorists will be required to turn left on to Roosevelt Avenue, right on to Stanton Terrace, right on to Mountain View Avenue, right on to upper Arthur Wint Drive and into the car parks.\u0095 NB: During the match, this section of the road will reopen to vehicular traffic.

In the US, an estimated 30 million Americans now take them daily. In the UK, almost one in four adults over age 40 are taking a statin drug.A similar trend continues worldwide as doctors struggle with the global epidemic of obesity and diabetes. Some physicians now prescribe statins on a preventive basis to their all-too-trusting patients. The common statin drugs include simvastatin, or Zocor, atorvastin marketed as Lipitor, and rosuvastatin, the generic name for Crestor.Doctors believe that their use will reduce an individual's risk of heart attack and stroke. Strangely, we are failing to reduce the incidence of heart attacks and strokes in our people, despite the popularity of these medicines. And if you are taking statins to lower your cholesterol, you might want to check out the insert in the package.Statin side effectsThe most common statin side effects listed include:Headache, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, dizziness, sexual dysfunction, flushing of the skin, liver damage, skin rash, muscle aches, tenderness or weakness, increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and kidney disease, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and pain, bloating, gas, diarrhoea or constipation.Recently the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has insisted that labels now carry additional warnings of memory loss and mental confusion.Cholesterol is a vital substance that is found in every cell of every organ of the body, with most of your cholesterol being manufactured by your liver. Statins lower cholesterol by interfering with important liver enzymes, so much so, that doctors must monitor the liver function of their patients on statins. I call these drugs liver toxins. They also deplete the cells of the muscles, heart, brain and nervous system of a critical nutrient and antioxidant called Coenzyme Q10, commonly abbreviated CoQ10. This antioxidant is key to cellular energy production, as well as neutralising harmful free radicals. This CoQ10 depletion may well account for the statin side effects highlighted by recent medical research and described below.Statins cause weaknessProfessor Beatrice Golomb, from the University of California at San Diego School of Medicine, has recently published a study that shows that the statin drugs can sap your energy.Golomb's findings, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, indicated that patients on statins were significantly more likely than those on a 'sugar pill' to experience low energy and fatigue when they exerted themselves. This problem occurred in people, particularly women just taking normal doses of these drugs.Both the heart (a special muscle) and our other muscles normally have very high levels of CoQ10 in their cells, and statin-induced depletion of this substance will understandably cause weakness and tiredness.Statins and painAnother study, conducted by French scientists, indicates that pain from taking statins is far more common than experts originally thought. Patients reported experiencing debilitating muscle pain and cramps, which, in some cases, left them unable to carry out everyday tasks or even made them bedridden. Myopathy, a nasty statin complication involving serious damage to muscle tissue, can be very serious problem.Researchers found that 10 per cent of people taking statins suffered from pain, and 30 per cent of them stopped taking the drug as a result. Previous studies on statins had underestimated the problem.Statins promote diabetesPatients with diabetes are often prescribed statins in an effort to prevent complications of this disease such as heart attacks and strokes. But, amazingly, statins themselves may greatly increase your risk for diabetes.Another study in 2012 in the medical journal The Lancet confirms that people with pre-diabetes are at very high risk for developing full-blown diabetes if they take statins. The research comes just after the FDA began requiring that statin labels warn users about an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.As both the liver and the muscles are organs involved in blood sugar control, it is not surprising that drugs that damage them can promote blood sugar imbalance. When a medication can cause a serious condition like diabetes, we have to question if the ends justify the means.Statins disturb brain functionEarlier this year, the FDA forced makers of statin drugs to include in the warnings little-known, newly recognised side effects: memory loss and mental confusion. While these mental disturbances were found in people over the age of 50, they can occur in any age group. Interestingly, CoQ10 levels in the brain cells decline with increasing age.Statins cause cataractYet another study published in the journal BMJ in 2010, documented an increased risk of cataracts in statin users. This discovery got little medical attention, but a new Canadian study published this year in the journal Optometry and Vision Science, has confirmed that cataracts are associated with statin use. Diabetic patients, in particular, who took statins, were at markedly greater risk for developing cataracts than those who did not take statins. It is significant that the lens of the eye needs cholesterol for proper development and lens transparency.If your doctor prescribes a statin drug: I suggest that you frankly discuss with him or her the risks and benefits of taking that medication. Ask about how much and for how long you are expected to take it. Enquire about lifestyle changes, nutritional supplements and other alternative methods that are available for managing your cholesterol more safely.If you do take statin drugs, you should supplement with CoQ10. Remember statins impair energy, deplete CoQ10 and increase free radical production in the cells.No official warnings exist in most countries about CoQ10 depletion by statin drugs. In Canada, however, labels warn of this danger and state that deficiency of CoQ10 \"could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.\" How amazing: drugs that are supposed to protect your heart may actually cause heart failure.You may email Dr Tony Vendryes at tonyvendryes@gmail.com or listen to 'An Ounce of Prevention' on POWER 106FM on Fridays at 8 p.m. His new book 'An Ounce of Prevention, Especially for Women' is available locally and on the Internet.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7447, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f9a316a50beea08b", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:03.219", "title": "Scenes from the National Honours and Awards Ceremony", "occurred_at": "2012-10-17T07:00:39", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121016/lead/lead91.html", "data": "\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7448, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6d07ac95a101f746", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:06.887", "title": "To god be the glory for 'Mama Joy'", "occurred_at": "2012-10-16T04:32:48", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121016/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Bursting with vim and vigour, and overflowing with happiness, Joy 'Mama Joy' Baker was caught up in Ellan Edward Neil's rendition of One Ting Lead To Annada, as she gyrated and danced on the lawns of King's House in St Andrew yesterday.The bubbly humanitarian was enjoying every moment of the occasion as she was made a member of the Order of Distinction in the rank of Officer at the National Honours and Awards investiture ceremony.Mama Joy was among the 157 Jamaicans who were presented with national honours and awards for outstanding contribution to the country's development through their service in various fields.The 64-year-old was being honoured for her service to the development of inner-city communities and the fostering of children.\"To do all the things that I have done and to get this award, I am feeling good.

Members of the public attending this event are asked to be seated by 3:30 p.m.Later today, at 7 p.m., the athletes will witness the 'Jamaica's Musical History Honouring our Olympic Journey' show.

The musical tribute was also on schedule.\"All is set up. We should start on time.

Some of them had to do surgery, some are still studying both here and overseas. It was at a great cost to them,\" she said.Evangelist Sandra Brooks will bless the event to start on the right note. Performers include mento sensation The Jolly Boys, reggae greats Leroy Sibbles, Marcia Griffiths, and Freddie McGregor, along with dancehall bigwigs including I-Octane, Konshens, and Beenie Man. Neita-Headley opined it was important to have all the different genres represented.\"When people see performers like The Jolly Boys, it's a lesson for them to see where the music is coming from. It's not just about what we experience today, which is dancehall,\" she said. \"So let's give them mento, ska, rocksteady, and some dancing as well.\"The 6,000 tickets for the event disappeared like canned food before a hurricane, but it will be televised with a screen outside the Arena in case of any overruns.

She was born and raised in London, England, to Jamaican parents, who are now retired in Jamaica. Thompson who recently was a guest conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO), in Jamaica, is a graduate of Liverpool University where she majored in music and Goldsmith's College where she majored in composition.Upon listening to Thompson's CD, New Nation Rising, one immediately hears the fusion of contemporary classical orchestrations with myriad popular and world music styles ranging from pop to R&amp;B and even African-inspired rhythms.The CD is a 21st century symphony that celebrates 1000 years of London's history. The RPO plays alongside two choirs, solo singers, a rapper and dhol drummers.But of most importance to Jamaica, is that Thompson was instrumental in getting the prestigious RPO to perform in Jamaica last month. In an interview with The Gleaner, Thompson tells how that came about and more.The talented and pioneering composer/conductor has come a long way from the days when as a four year-old she tinkled on a piano stored in the neighbour's attic. She developed a trained ear from early too as she was interested in the sounds that emanated from all instruments. After years of training, working and touring the world, Thompson wanted to share some of the wealth of the music she loves with the land of her parents' birth. Over the years, she developed a friendship with Nigel Clarke, founding chairman of the National Youth Orchestra of Jamaica (NYOJ). Thompson says two years ago on a visit, they were having a conversation when Clarke told her of his desire to have the RPO perform in Jamaica. Having shared the same dream and because of her relationship with the RPO, she gladly made the necessary introductions.\"I introduced Nigel Clarke to the RPO's management,\" she told The Gleaner from her relaxed position in the gardens of Devon House. The rest is history but following the captivating performance at the historic North Street Cathedral, she is extremely proud that her initial introduction made it happen. But just how did Thompson become so influential? She tells her story.Education workshopsThompson first met the RPO several years ago while she was working on a series of education workshops in schools in London. She is also an accomplished director and film-maker who is usually commissioned for major works. Since the initial meeting, she has toured and worked extensively with the RPO.Her formal introduction to music came while in primary school at age 10. Having played the piano since the age of four, in school she also played the recorder until a famous violin teacher visited the class and she got an opportunity to play that instrument. She played it till she got the chance to take serious piano lessons age 14. \"I used to make up melodies and tunes and I had the opportunity to play with various orchestras during my teens. No other people of colour in my environment were doing that (playing in an orchestra), and I got a deep understanding of the music from playing with various orchestras such as: string, chamber, brass and the London Youth Orchestra. I also sang with big choirs and while in university I played with the choir and orchestra,\" she shared.\"Having studied music to that degree, I pursued a career as a composer and started writing music for television shows. I was one of three female composers in the '90s when I started.\" She wrote the theme and incidental music for The Londoners, said the woman who now holds PhD. in music. She has also written music for several documentaries. It became the source of her income and continues to be, and she has received much admiration for her pioneering attitude. She had no precedent and continues to be a forerunner for women in composing music for television to this day. She earned her reputation in film-making while being a successful composer. Another tour Last monthFollowing her departure from the island last month (she returns home up to three times a year), Thompson was off on yet another tour. Stops include Buenos Aries, the Kennedy Centre in the United States and then South Africa next February. For the immediate future, she will also be working on an opera for the Royal Opera House. With all her achievements, Thompson still yearns to put aspects of the fantastic tapestry of the Jamaican story to classical music.\"I want to write the Jamaican story; to see an opera to show how we use music to tell our stories and inform people. It will have dance, singers, the spoken word and more,\" she said, becoming obviously animated and thrilled at the prospect. She is not ruling out the use of reggae, hip-hop in the classic either.But that's in the future. There have been many high points in her life to date. \"I am thrilled and exceedingly proud of what I have achieved against all odds. I was expected to be a factory worker but now look at me! I have composed ballets. In 40 years I am the first woman of any race to have composed a symphony in Europe and I had the honour of writing the music for The Queen's 50th jubilee celebrations,\" she noted.Other Achievements  In 2007, Thompson was commissioned to compose music for the opening of the Parliamentary exhibition, \"The British Slave Trade: Abolition, Parliament and People\" Spirit of the Middle Passage for three solo singers, spoken word artiste and chamber orchestra was performed by The Philharmonic Orchestra in the Queen Elizabeth Hall as part of the Freedom &amp; Culture International Creative Forum. The work featured three heroines, including Nanny of the Maroons.  In 2009 Thompson was commissioned by Southbank Centre to compose a piece to commemorate 100 days of Barack Obama's presidency. Thompson was the first woman to compose and direct music for a major drama series at the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Having trained as a television programme maker at the BBC and Carlton Television she directed the film, Memories in Mind, with an award from the Arts Council, which was broadcast by the BBC in 1998. In 2010 Thompson was announced in the Evening Standard's \"Power List of Britain's 100 Most Influential Black People 2010\". Thompson is Reader in Music at the University of Westminster. Her body of solo and instrumental ensemble works for concert hall as well as working as a freelance composer of music for TV, films and the theatre, is well documented.The Shirley Thompson Ensemble was formed in 1994 and has been the main vehicle for her instrumental and vocal works.barbara.ellington@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7463, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ff946d93e240312b", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:18.246", "title": "Payless for breast cancer awareness", "occurred_at": "2012-10-16T04:32:48", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121015/lead/lead92.html", "data": "For the second year in a row, Payless ShoeSource has shown its support for breast cancer awareness with this year's featured accessory item - the 2012 Payless Breast Cancer Awareness (BCA) bracelet.

Between January 1 and September 22 this year, 553 were victims of the act compared with 172 persons last year.Shetty attributed the increase to the availability of sexually explicit materials in society.\"Some people think that sex is something physical that you do to a person rather than it happening in the context of a relationship. The whole sexualised society - all the pornography, all the 'Dutty Wine' songs playing in the bus - makes children get curious, and sometimes they themselves expose themselves to sexual activities,\" he added.Call for collaborative approachShetty called for a collaborative approach between Government and various stakeholders in addressing the growing problem.\"Everyone has a responsibility to prevent this. They all have to assist in addressing the problem - the teachers, parents, the community, everybody,\" he said.Counselling psychologist Pauline Bain said the act has been going on for many years, but children who are affected seem to be speaking out more about the issue.\"Children are more aware and so they are learning how to talk about rape and sexual molestation, and in some situations in schools, they may be taught that they need to tell somebody if they have been raped, or sexually molested.\"She added, \"I think that some children are speaking out because they are hearing the recent news items which stir up memories and they need to get rid of the heavy burden and secrets that they have been carrying.\"\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7874, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d53c0c7634f07d92", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:56:51.911", "title": "Travel agents begin arriving for taste of Jamaica", "occurred_at": "2012-09-12T06:40:18", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120911/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Janet Silvera, Senior Gleaner WriterWESTERN BUREAU:The first group of 800 United States and Canadian travel agents invited to sample the island's tourism product over the next five weeks, have started to arrive in the country.The agents, who started arriving on the island last Thursday, have been dispatched into the resort towns of Montego Bay, Ocho Rios and Negril, Minister of Tourism and Entertainment Dr Wykeham McNeill told The Gleaner.\"We invited 1,500 agents, 800 have confirmed so far,\" McNeill revealed, explaining that under the guidance of the Jamaica Tourist Board (JTB), the agents would saturate the market in the five weeks, leaving the island educated about the rich and vibrant tourism product.The trip will allow them access to experience all of the attractions here, while visiting the majority of the hotels. Their visit happens during a period classified as the slowest in the industry.\"September so far is slightly up over last year, but it remains the worst month of the year. It's a tough month, the time when all the children go back to school and all the financial difficulties set in,\" explained Tourism Director John Lynch.Like the tourism director, the minister is optimistic that Jamaica has done reasonably well this year, in relation to stop-over visitors.And both concur that September and October being the renowned challenging months for the industry was the perfect time to expose the product to those who sell it.They argue that these familiarisation trips were even more pivotal at this time, owing to the fact it is an election year in the United States, and \"People are not thinking travel, so it suits us to put an additional crank into the system\".\"I feel the 800 figure now confirmed, could move up to 1,000 agents in the long run,\" said Lynch.Looking for testimonialsLynch, who has worked as regional director in the JTB's overseas offices for several years, said a good percentage of travellers who have never left the US, particularly young travellers, are looking for third-party testimonials before they venture outside of their country.\"Travel agents, who were felt to be extinct are the ones they go to.\"According to him an educated agent is the best thing a country dependent on tourism could have.Lynch described the new breed of agents as nimble and technology savvy.\"They have had to make themselves relevant, through the use of the Internet,\" he said.Complementing this group, a large team of top agents from Germany is expected in the island this November.\"This is the season for familiarisation trips, this is when you lay the base,\" said Lynch.In addition, he promised that specialised agents would visit the island later this year to experience Kingston and Port Antonio.\"Port Antonio and Kingston can handle smaller trips,\" he said.janet.silvera@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7465, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6bab4c978f8bc358", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:20.640", "title": "Senators want tougher penalty for leaked information", "occurred_at": "2012-10-15T06:38:02", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121015/lead/lead94.html", "data": "Daraine Luton, Senior Staff ReporterA proposal in the regulations for the establishment of a sex offenders registry, which says persons who are guilty of the unauthorised release of information on sex offenders will be subject to up to a quarter-million-dollar fine and/or three months' imprisonment, has been shut down by three legislators.Opposition senators Robert Montague and Kamina Johnson Smith joined their government colleague, Lambert Brown, in saying there was an inconsistency with penalties for breaches.The regulations, which have been approved by the Senate, say a sex offender must, at all times while he is away from his main residence, have a certificate of sex offender on his person. Failure to do so could lead to him being fined up to $1 million and/or subjected to 12 months' imprisonment.\"I can't accept that somebody who wilfully releases confidential information should be subject merely to three months' imprisonment, or a fine up to $250,000, but somebody who rushes to take their mother to the hospital in an emergency could be fined up to $1 million, or 12 months' imprisonment,\" Brown said.\"The fact that somebody committed a sexual offence is not reason to be battering them with the likelihood of a sentence of up to $1 million,\" Brown added.A delicate issueJohnson Smith voiced her concern about the matter during the debate, saying the offender's right for privacy must be protected. She pointed to issues such as mob violence and said care must be taken to ensure proper treatment of sensitive information.\"The potential impact of the unauthorised or inappropriate release of information could certainly be far greater than we might ever intend,\" Johnson Smith said.Similarly, Montague said the penalty for the wilfully unauthorised release of information should be much tougher, arguing that vigilante justice could be the end result of such action.\"It may be applied, not even in a sexual matter, but because he is a person of interest, people in the district get suspicious. Somebody lose their goat and the first person you turn to is the man who is purported to be on the registry,\" Montague said.In the the meantime, Justice Minister Mark Golding, who piloted the regulations, said they represented new ground for Jamaica.\"If necessary, down the road, we will have to adjust this regime. It is a new regime charting new ground for Jamaica. It is not a perfect system by any means,\" Golding said.The regulations allow for the sex offender's name to be stored in the registry for at least 10 years, after which time it is removed.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7466, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1f096ec57503d223", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:21.087", "title": "Knight calls for proper funding for parenting commission", "occurred_at": "2012-10-15T06:38:02", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121015/lead/lead95.html", "data": "Government Senator K.D. Knight on Friday said the National Parenting Support Commission should not be starved of financial resources, saying if that happens, the country may not be able to reap the game-changing results that are anticipated from the setting up of the body.\"This programme must never ever be underfunded,\" Knight said as he contributed to the debate on the National Parenting Support Commission Bill in the Senate.The bill, which has already been passed in the House of Represen-tatives, was passed in the Senate without amendment. It will now be sent to the governor general for his assent.The commission is to carry out activities that assist parents in fulfilling their roles and responsibilities as outlined in the National Parenting Policy.The commission will aim to support parents by increasing their access to quality information and services. Parents will also learn about their responsibilities under the law and the consequences of not fulfilling them, particularly as it relates to abuse or neglect.Knight said, \"Oftentimes, these noble, laudable ideals cannot be pursued because of the absence of proper funding. This now has to be seen as a priority, and the appropriate funding must be provided by the Cabinet, and the Parliament must ensure this otherwise us talking about its capacity to be a game changer would be meaningless.\"The government senator pointed to Jamaica's discussions with the International Monetary Fund and said he hoped it would never be the case that the work of the commission suffered because of a dictate from an agency.\"This is a priority programme. Jamaica needs to change. This can help to change it, and it must happen,\" Knight said.The senator has suggested that sometime in the future, a mechanism be put in place to allow philanthropists to contribute to the commission in exchange for tax relief.Sandrea Falconer, who piloted the bill, embraced the call for proper funding for the commission.\"It is going to cost a lot of money if we are going to go to every nook and cranny of Jamaica, to go to parents in their homes to affect their perception of what parenting is about. We cannot fail,\" Falconer said.Opposition Senator Kavan Gayle said while Parliament is passing the law to give effect to the commission, legislators must recognise that a major cultural change is needed in the society.\"We are not a society that easily assimilates change,\" Gayle said.

He has generally been quick to accept when something is going wrong and is amenable to change.But for some reason unknown, Golding, who is the justice minister, in the face of well-placed impassioned plea about an area of concern in the regulations for the sexual offences registry, made the matter slide.The matter relates to the penalty for persons who improperly discloses information from the sexual offences register about sex offenders.During the debate on the regulations in the Senate on Friday, three senators - Kamina Johnson Smith, Lambert Brown and Robert Montague - argued for the $250,000 penalty to be increased for the unauthorised and improper disclosure of the information.They argued that the release of such information may have dire consequences for sex offenders. We associate ourselves with that position. Sex offenders, having already served time behind bars, are to have their names, date of birth, address and even car licence plates recorded. If the sex offenders change address they must give that information, and almost as if they are on parole they must carry around with them a certificate of sexual offender.The Gavel won't argue the fairness, or lack thereof, of the way in which sex offenders are to be monitored. Instead, our issue is on that of confidentiality. Like the three named senators, it is our view that the fine is ridiculously too low. We don't need to live under rocks to know that rogue elements in communities, having been in receipt of the information, can decide to exact their own brand of justice against a sex offender.It is for this reason we feel the fine should be $5 million or a maximum three years' imprisonment.It must be noted that these sex offenders would have already served time in prison for their crimes. Now, having been released back into society, their names and other personal information are to be stored for at least 10 years in the register. Now, we don't condone any acts of violence but neither do we believe that a man's past is his potential. Nonetheless, it is with good reason we believe that the state sets the penalty of $1 million and or twelve months' imprisonment for failure of a man, who has already served his time, to walk around with his sex offender's pass. The message the state is clearly sending, and rightfully so, is that once you are a sex offender you will be monitored, and if you fail to comply it will be costly.However, it is such a pity the state does not put such premium on the safety of the offenders once they have been released.The Gavel also takes issue with the requirement of the regulations for the particulars of the victims to be kept in the register. The regulations call for the name, address and telephone number and email address of the victim to be kept in the register.We feel that this is totally unnecessary when one considers that victims of a sex offence spend a life-time trying to put the ordeal behind them. It is our view that all records relating to vitcims of sex crimes must die at the end of a criminal trial.On another matter, The Gavel is calling upon Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller to bring leadership to tackling the country's crime problem. It is our view that the use of the Parliament can go a far way in helping to make Jamaica a safe and secure country.We recall Simpson Miller, as opposition leader, calling for the House Leader to set aside time in the Parliament to discuss solutions to tackle the country's crime problem\"Crime robs us of seven per cent of GDP. Crime increases the number of trauma cases in our hospitals, it reduces the productivity of businesses and it affects the ability of our children to learn,\" Simpson Miller said in her 2010-2011 Budget speech.\"We are therefore recommending that we take time to discuss in the Parliament the levels of crime in the country and the actions that, as a people, we must be take. We must send a strong signal to the country that as a Parliament, we are united on this critical issue,\" Simpson Miller said.The only thing that has changed since that recommendation is that she is now Prime Minister and the People's National Party which she leads now forms the government. Now, more than ever, the country needs all hands on deck in the fight against crime. Simpson Miller must put action to her pronouncement made from the comfort of her seat as opposition leader.She should instruct House Leader Phillip Paulwell and National Security Minister Peter Bunting to arrange such a debate, which we believe could take place one Wednesday per month.thegavel@gleanerjm.comParliamentary schedule Tuesday - 2 p.m. -              Sitting of the House of Representatives  Wednesday - 10 a.m. Public Administration &amp; Appropriations Committee  Wednesday \u0097 2 p.m. -              Joint Select Committee on Committal Proceedings Act 2012  AGENDA Minister of Industry, Investment and Commerce Anthony Hylton will move a motion for the lifting of the economic and financial blockade against Cuba.

The CDA does not remand children to police stations.\"We cannot take a child in need of care and protection to a police lock-up \u0085 . That defeats the purpose,\" said an adamant Francis Edie.In a subsequent emailed response, the agency further claimed that having reviewed the Detention and Courts Divisions list, it believes that the information as captured, which identifies the arresting officer as the CDA, is misleading.\"For example, today (Friday) the CDA received the Detention and Courts listing for this week, ending October 12, and one of the entries again lists the CDA as the arresting officer.\"When we did our investigation, it showed that the child was taken by the police from a place of safety to court. Afterwards, the child was to have been returned to the facility. However, the child was instead taken to a police station by the police officer,\" the CDA said in its respone.NOT BUYING STORYBut Dr Carolyn Gomes, executive director of human-rights lobby Jamaicans for Justice (JFJ), is not buying the CDA's denial.According to Gomes, the CDA's response was incredulous.\"That excuse makes no sense. It is not a mistake in one report. If it is a mistake, it's a mistake in dozens and dozens of reports,\" said Gomes.\"Why wasn't it corrected previously? The claims come from many police divisions in their reports to CDA and nobody saw it?\"Is it that they don't read the reports and have the mistakes corrected, or is it that it is not a mistake? It is highly unlikely that it is a mistake that would go uncorrected for so long,\" argued Gomes.The human-rights activist charged that it was unconscionable to think that children removed from abusive homes were being placed in jail.\"To put a child who needs care and protection in a police lock-up is a disgrace, and to have the CDA putting them in there is a breach of the law,\" she charged.Gomes continued: \"If it's a mistake, it shows a high degree of incompetence to allow such an egregious mistake of that nature to persist for so long.\"tyrone.reid@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7469, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/777b8cffecfffa3f", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:22.466", "title": "Cheap justice?\n\nMinistry hit with demands to pay more than $200m it owes", "occurred_at": "2012-10-15T06:38:02", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121014/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Erica Virtue, Senior Gleaner WriterThe justice ministry has found itself with two bills totalling more than $200 million that it did not budget for, and the creditors are demanding their money.Justice Minister Senator Mark Golding has confirmed that the Urban Development Corporation (UDC) is demanding outstanding payments for rental of the Jamaica Conference Centre (JCC) while fees owed to the Norman Manley Law School since 2008 are also past due.Golding said it was recently brought to his attention that the UDC is seeking his assistance in having the ministry pay up.\"I can't tell you offhand what the figure is, but I know it's more than $100 million that is owed for rental of the Jamaica Conference Centre for court sittings,\" Golding told The Sunday Gleaner.\"It took me completely by surprise when it was brought to my attention recently that that this balance is outstanding,\" added Golding.At least two High Court sittings were held at the JCC, which was also the site of a dramatic commission of enquiry in 2011, which probed issues surrounding the extradition request for former Tivoli Gardens don, Christopher 'Dudus' Coke, and the hiring of the American law firm Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips to intervene in the matter.Golding could not say if the bill for the JCC includes payment for the time of the enquiry.\"Good question. But I really can't tell you if the figure includes rental for the period over which the commission of enquiry was held,\" said Golding.\"It was brought to my attention in September, and it was up to date to that month. The landlord (UDC) is requesting of us that we find the funds to pay, so we are going to have discussion with the UDC and the Ministry of Finance about how we deal with it.\"BILL BROUGHT FORWARDAccording to Golding, a large part of the bill was brought forward from previous financial years, plus what has accumulated since the start of the 2012-2013 financial year.The amount owed to the Norman Manley Law School has a similar ring.\"There is a big accumulated balance owing to the Norman Manley Law School, which was brought to my attention last week.\"Again, it is my understanding that since academic year 2008, the school is owed a total of $113 million, and it includes balances from previous years which have accumulated to that total,\" he explained.Golding said the outstanding money is part of the Government's budgetary contribution to the law school.\"The contributions may not be paid in full and it has kept accumulating since 2008. As a result, the ministry's finances are now being impacted by these bills from the prior Government,\" he stated.DEBT NEWS TO CHUCKHowever, Delroy Chuck, the man who headed the justice ministry immediately prior to Golding, told The Sunday Gleaner that the reports of the accumulated debt to the UDC was news to him.\"It's the first I am hearing that. I have never really been involved in that,\" said Chuck.According to Chuck, the two courts which sit at the JCC could not have accumulated such a huge bill.Chuck, an attorney-at-law and former law lecturer, said he was also not aware of the debt to the law school.\"It's the first I'm hearing that, too. To be frank, I am not surprised that the different ministries owe these sums of money because over the last many years, Government has always been in backlog of payment, not only on judgments, but also to jurors, and also to the different institutions.

We had nothing to do with that!\" he declared.According to Wong, an additional US$9.3 million of the US$75 million was utilised by the Office of the Prime Minister, which initiated another programme that was approved by the permanent secretary in December 2011.FLUCTUATING COSTS\"We also had fluctuation in excess of US$20 million \u0085 . Fluctuation is when the basic price of materials such as asphalt and steel as quoted in the contract escalates, and we had a serious escalation beyond our control. The contract speaks to that. It's automatic.\"Wong noted that fluctuations in the price of material are not the same as variations in the cost of the project.\"These are things beyond our control. We can't know how much asphalt is going to be, and we can't predict the price of steel. So there weren't any overruns. There were merely additional expenditures - all approved by the various entities.\"Wong charged that then Minister of Transport and Works Mike Henry informed the ministry, the Road Maintenance Fund, and the NWA that US$150 million would be provided in the Budget for JDIP for 2011-2012.\"So we planned accordingly, incorporating the Tropical Storm Nicole damage and other expenditures, and we came up with a US$150-million programme. This was submitted in October 2011 to the China EXIM Bank to be drawn down on the loan for 2011-2012.\"MAINTENANCE FUND UNDERPERFORMINGAccording to Wong, the China EXIM Bank wrote to the Road Maintenance Fund to advise that it was underperforming, which meant that it would be drawing down less.\"The end result is that accommodating the fluctuations and everything else, we spent US$148 million between April 2011 and March 2012, which is the normal financial year, so the rate of expenditure was well within what was promised to the minister and the ministry.\"Wong further charged that this expenditure should have been placed in the Supplementary Estimates for the fiscal year, but this was not done, although the programme was in train.\"I wrote, in September 2011, to the minister and the ministry informing them that with all these extra works to be done \u0085the programme would be shut down in September 2011.\"According to Wong, despite the clamour from individual members of parliament for work to be done in their constituencies, Cabinet refused to act.Wong said Henry took a note to Cabinet dated September 30, 2011, informing his colleagues that if the additional budget of US$50 million was not injected, the programme would be closed, but no response was forthcoming.\"Again, there is collective responsibility,\" Wong stressed. gary.spalding@gleanerjm.com&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7471, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eb9dc434a1035887", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:23.392", "title": "Wrong on Wong", "occurred_at": "2012-10-15T06:38:02", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121014/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Gary Spaulding, Senior Gleaner WriterDespite facing the bulk of the criticisms for the mismanagement of the Jamaica Development Infrastructure Programme (JDIP), former chief executive officer of the National Works Agency (NWA), Patrick Wong, says he has no regrets over his stewardship of the project.Wong broke his silence in an exclusive interview with The Sunday Gleaner days after a forensic audit on the project was tabled in Parliament.The long-serving public servant was forced to resign from the NWA in November 2011 after a damning report by the auditor general into the operations of the JDIP.But last week, Wong noted that he had waited silently for one year for the release of the forensic audit, and despite the criticisms, the auditors found only procedural breaches and no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.Wong charged that he was the victim of a political football match played out by members of the Jamaica Labour Party and the People's National Party.According to Wong, he was given the proverbial basket to carry water in the lead-up to the 2011 general election.\"It (JDIP) was the product of collective responsibility \u0085 . The country's infrastructure was damaged and had to be repaired ... . The likes of the Yallahs pipeline had to be repaired in the national interest, and we were not given the resources. No one can dispute what I am saying,\" charged Wong as he rejected the claim that he had wilted under pressure.The auditors found that after coming under tremendous pressure from politicians, Wong chose to ignore the approved budget, in favour of meeting the demands, resulting in JDIP expenditure of approximately US$20 million and US$75 million over budget in 2011 and 2012, respectively.INFRASTRUCTURE IN BAD SHAPEWong told The Sunday Gleaner that he was driven to act by the parlous state of the nation's infrastructure.\"It was in such bad shape, and everybody (members of parliament on both sides of the political divide) was making excessive demands,\" Wong argued, even as he questioned the conduct of the politicians.\"Where were their voices when the Budget was being crafted and approved in Parliament?\"Wong insisted that no other infrastructural initiative before the JDIP had been exposed to such levels of quality assurance and quality control.He said the selection of the subcontractors, which was criticised by the auditors, was in accordance with an unwritten protocol.\"The unwritten protocol was established by former Prime Minister P.J.

His producers were denying it was done on the inside. They said it was recorded after his first brush with the law,\" added Prendergast.He told The Sunday Gleaner that any request seeking for the artiste to record songs from behind bars would be denied.Kartel has been in custody since October 1 last year when he and four other persons were arrested for possession of ganja.He was subsequently charged with murder in relation to the deaths of businessman Barrington 'Bossy' Burton and Clive 'Lizard' Williams.Following his arrest, the release of songs such as Back to Life, in which he speaks of life behind bars and mentions missing his Benz motor car which he bought only months before going to prison, have sparked speculation that the World Boss is getting special privileges behind bar.pre-jail songsBut in an article published in The Star earlier this year when the allegations started to swell, one of Kartel's producers said the songs were done before the deejay's latest brush with the law in October 2011.The producer, Elvis Redwood, was adamant that no special recording privileges were being given to Kartel whose correct name is Adidja Palmer.\"The Busta Rhymes collaboration with Vybz Kartel was recorded in 2010 by Don Corleon. It was a live recording on Ustream, so they can check that. When artistes record songs, they have to choose the right time to release them and Vybz Kartel has a lot of unreleased songs,\" said Redwood at the time.\"Back To Life was recorded in 2010 under the title We Wah Guh Home, but it was never released. We changed the name, fix up some little things, and just call it Back To Life. It's a prison song about his experience in jail, it was just another jail song.\"He has a lot of jail songs but because of the current situation, people are making assumptions ... but we just want to make it clear that Vybz Kartel has not recorded any material since his incarceration,\" Redwood said in that interview.That might be enough for the head of the DCS for now but Prendergast has already made it clear that if evidence comes across his desk suggesting that the songs are being recorded from the Horizon Adult Remand Centre, he would launch an investigation into the matter.\"If I suspected there was a breach, it would be thoroughly investigated and the appropriate action taken,\" warned Prendergast.The commissioner of corrections explained that he has turned down requests for other entertainers to do songs while incarcerated.However, he pointed out that there is a recording studio at the Tower Street Adult Correctional Centre, which forms part of that institution's rehabilitation offering.That was how singer Jah Cure was able to record songs while incarcerated and serving time for rape.tyrone.reid@gleanerjm.comSome reasons why people claim Kartel is recording behind bars  Vybz Kartel and Gaza Slim's Reparation single, released in 2012 during the police's move to clamp down on the lottery scam, speaks clearly to this issue.

I grew a lot there, and that is where I developed my greatest maturity,\" Hay said with pride as she described her time at the Office of the DPP.She added that she met some of the best criminal law practitioners in the country there.Llewellyn described Hay as a very loyal prosecutor whose wealth of experience, hard work, and high level of professionalism will be greatly missed at the Office of the DPP.Hay has appeared in many prominent cases in the Court of Appeal, Circuit Courts, and the Resident Magistrate's Court.She was the lead prosecutor in the case of Sheldon Pusey, who was convicted of the manslaughter of Ambassador Peter King.She successfully argued against the abuse-of-process application by former Matthews Lane strongman Donald 'Zeeks' Phipps, who is currently serving a sentence for double murder.Hay was also lead counsel last month for the DPP and the Dutch Government in the Trafigura case in which People's National Party officials are seeking declarations from the Constitutional Court.She has worked with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Organisation of American States, the Caribbean Financial Action Task, Force, the Commonwealth Secretariat and several prosecutors' associations.In parting words of advice to her colleagues, Hay urges prosecutors to always be prepared by focusing on their cases, reading widely, researching, and identifying the issues in advance.\"I would encourage the prosecutors not to be disheartened by the limitations we face in terms of resources, but to focus on what you can do, and do it well,\" she said.Although Hay did not disclose where she was taking up her new job, she confessed that she was leaving her present post with a feeling of sadness as it had been home to her for over a decade.She said that as an anti-money-laundering expert, she wants to continue to work with policymakers and regulated entities to strengthen their internal regimes and to ensure that safe havens are not created in the Caribbean.\"In fact, we should lead the world on how to do this right.\"I know that the firm that is planning to receive me is as excited over the prospects as I am,\" she added. \n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7475, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e8b18273e45349ef", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:25.384", "title": "Mosquitoes, be gone!\n\nSupreme Court building to be fogged", "occurred_at": "2012-10-15T06:38:02", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121014/lead/lead6.html", "data": "Court Management Services (CMS) has responded to fears of a dengue outbreak affecting workers at the Supreme Court by instituting measures to get rid of the mosquitoes.Last week, The Gleaner reported that members of staff at the Supreme Court were worried about  the large number of mosquitoes in the building.But yesterday, the CMS said arrangements had been made with the Ministry of Health to have the building fogged for this weekend.\"The decision was taken to carry out such vector-control activities on the weekend in an effort to ensure the health and safety of our employees,\" said the CMS.It also announced that the problem with the air-conditioning units at the Supreme Court were being addressed.\"Two central units that supply four courtrooms and 12 judge's chambers have been repaired; a new air-conditioning unit was installed in one of the judge's chambers; and the other unit, which is located in the Criminal Registry, is currently being repaired and should be completed over the weekend.\"The CMS also reported that preparations for the establishment of a maintenance contract for air-conditioning units in courts islandwide were at an advanced stage.\"This kind of proactive maintenance should facilitate a reduction in the sporadic malfunctioning of the units,\" said CMS as it added that it was making every effort to correct any issues that existed within the courts, even in the context of limited resources.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7476, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d78fe4bc5359c76c", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:25.832", "title": "Ganja must run in prisons!

You get stabbed fi di simplest thing. A dat mi a tell you,\" said the ex-convict.According to the ex-convict, ganja helps to reduce the levels of depression in the prisons, leaving a calming effect.But weed in prison proves to be an expensive tranquiliser, as a mint-sized ball of ganja which would sell for $20 on the street is sold for $100 or more behind bars.But cost is not a deterrent, as ganja seems to be the psychological drug of choice of many prisoners who use it to cope with long sentences.\"When you think about your children, yuh girl, the people dem weh you love, things you miss doing, and can't do anymore, the weed is a comforter. It calms the spirit.\"When man frass (don't smoke fi days), warders dem 'fraid 'cause dem know di potential fi rioting is at a maximum,\" said the ex-con.That was supported by a warder who spent more than a decade working in the prison system.\"I never used to carry in no weed but me know the man them have it and a pure trouble some man gi when them can't get a spliff (a hand-rolled ganja cigarette).\"Boasting that he is free of smoke related or mental illness despite smoking the weed for many years while incarcerated, the ex-con argued, \"I would a mad long time if it wasn't for ganja, and the whole prison population would a mad too. If ganja no deh a prison, it's like the whole prison set on fire.\"According to the ex-con, when prisoners are happy, warders are comfortable.Notice also agrees although he wants research to take place on a long-term basis to verify the effects of the usage of ganja on both warders and prisoners.But with the prison bosses not yet ready to officially sanction the use of ganja in the facilities, inmates aided by some warders get the weed through the prison gates.When that doesn't work, they turn to other methods such as just having persons, on the outside throw the weed over the fence.Oftentimes weed, stuffed in boxes or plastic bottles, is tossed on to the prison compound at prearranged times.erica.virtue@gleanerjm.com&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7477, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d06f87a20467688", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:26.302", "title": "No lighting up!", "occurred_at": "2012-10-15T06:38:02", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121014/lead/lead62.html", "data": "Prison boss committed to keeping ganja out of the hands of inmates even if some warders disagreeJamaica's prison boss, Lieutenant Colonel Sean Prendergast, has admitted that the Department of Correctional Services (DCS) is struggling to stem the flow of ganja into the prisons.According to Prendergast, the nifty methods used by smugglers to get the weed into the prisons keep evolving.\"One inmate stitched it into the lining of his clothes.

At 14, his grandmother kicked him out after a disagreement with an aunt.\"I had one shirt, one pants and one pair of shoes. And I had some small holes in them,\" he said.Heartbroken, Ghunta asked complete strangers for shelter. He was eventually offered a shack in Pell River in the parish, a piece of sponge was his new bed.Living on his own, Ghunta did odd jobs to feed himself while going to Rusea's High School.Today, he is a transformational speaker, social activist and 'Dreamrighter', telling young people they have the right to dream big and to achieve despite their circumstances.DREAMRIGHTHe uses a philosophy he has dubbed DREAMRIGHT.According to Ghunta every letter in the acronym is important.DreamRight To DreamExercise Self-ControlAct/AttitudeMaster Your CraftReadIndividuality/ImaginationGoodwill To OthersHumilityTenacity (Try And Try).He said he created this concept at age 12 and has lived by it.\"I looked at the life my mother was living and I said I can achieve something else out of this life. Each and every human being ... every one of us has a right to be here, a right to dream, a right to bloom.\"Regarding the name change, Ghunta explained he burned his stomach as a child while reaching for tea. He would rub the stomach saying 'Bunta' meaning burn.At Rusea's, due to his track abilities, they started calling him 'Gunta'.\"At one point I was called 'Hunta' as well, that's why it's 'Gh' now,\" he said.'Juleus' was a name he got from an uncle and recently, he found out his last name was actually Lambert. 'Craig Dixon' means nothing to him.\"The fact is, Juleus Ghunta, those names motivate me. When I hear them, I feel like I can do anything.\" He has taken his 'dreamright' message mostly around the region through the Caribbean Internship Programme.However, he spoke in Rwanda in 2010 when he was among young leaders in the Commonwealth Youth Leadership Training Programme.Ghunta recently told his tale of perseverance to participants at the Governor General's I Believe Youth Consultative County Conference for Surrey.A transfixed group heard of the days when, in that Pell River shack, he used pans to capture the water which leaked through the roof. \t\"I would wake up at 4 a.m. (to get to school). I ate what I had. Sometimes it was mangoes, sometimes it was pear and salt. Sometimes it was nothing,\" he recalled.He would walk through Lucea on his heels because his shoes had holes and he didn't want to ruin his socks.

McConnell, has hit out against the Government's plan to use more of the Caymanas Estates land in St Catherine for housing development, describing it as misguided.He told The Gleaner: \"I say to them, why do you want to develop land that is already in production and earning foreign exchange for the country? Why don't you go and do your development on idle lands?\" Pointing out that there is a lot of idle land running alongside the new highway in the parish, McConnell insisted, \"It just doesn't make any sense.\"Worthy Park Estates cultivates sugar cane on 500 hectares of land at Caymanas to supplement the crop reaped from land at their factory at Lluidas Vale and land leased in Bog Walk also in the parish. However, even with the cane grown by contract farmers, the company is only able to process at most some 180,000 tonnes of cane per year. This is well shy of the estimated 300,000 tonnes of cane required to give its operation maximum throughput efficiency of producing 30,000 tonnes of sugar for a year. Having produced only 21,000 tonnes of cane last year, the factory is well off the mark, having last hit 24,000 tonnes some 12 years ago, according to McConnell.Worthy Park had been negotiating with the former People's National Party (PNP) administration to lease sugar lands at Inswood, but with full divestment of the country's cane assets, that parcel went to Complant.Speaking during a tour of the Worthy Park Estate by Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Roger Clarke on Thursday, McConnell recalled the disappointment of that deal falling through. The failure to get a long-term lease of the land has also hampered efforts to raise productivity.\"We were hoping that we would have got Inswood but that didn't come to pass.

He believes this is linked to the housing development earmarked for the area and is set against the utilisation of prime productive farmland for this purpose.\"I am totally against that because we have so much land right on the highway that can be put into all these uses that they are talking about.

Patterson, while responding to a question posed by residents, pointed to the area where the new bridge is located and indicated that a replacement bridge would be constructed there.On Friday, Davies reiterated that the Government is on a quest to tackle the country's infrastructure, which is paramount for any real economic growth. While stressing the importance of restoring the basic infrastructure islandwide, the minister noted that the repairing, construction, and upgrading of the country's infrastructure will not be influenced by partisan politics, noting that \"it is not appropriate to use the selection of infrastructural projects as a way of determining political rivalry\".

He also pointed out that Chinese engineers also shared their skills and experience with Jamaican workers, who are now more knowledgable about the technical aspects of bridge construction.Meantime, both members of parliament - Daryl Vaz in West Portland, and Linvale Bloomfield in East Portland - expressed gratitude for the new bridge, which not only links both constituencies, but will provide a smoother and easier ride for motorists and other visitors to the parish.The Rio Grande bridge links the parish capital Port Antonio to the rest of Western Portland and is the main access route between the parish and a number of the island's commercial centres such as Kingston, Ocho Rios, and Montego Bay. The two-lane bridge has a length of approximately 230 metres and has a design life of 75 years.The original bridge was partially destroyed by Hurricane Dennis in July 2005, and was rendered unsafe for vehicular traffic.

I don't understand. Parents must do a little better in making their children understand good values,\" Reynolds, affectionately called Miss Rose, shared with The Gleaner.NEED TO BUILD FOUNDATIONShe said instead of nurturing their children, which is critical in creating the foundation for them to become sociable and loving adults, they engage in meaningless activities.\"The way how I see people looking after them children now, sometimes night come down and they don't know where their children are. They must talk with them, love them. They must be concerned about them. Some parents dress up and walk up and down doing nothing. They don't check if they get homework and make sure they do it,\" she said.Her main priority when she and husband, Leon, of more than 50 years, were raising their five children - four boys and one girl - was ensuring that they got the best care, love, and educational opportunities.This has paid off as her eldest child, Spencer Reynolds, is the housing and infrastructure manager at Food For The Poor. Devon, their second child, is managing director at West Indies Synthetics Company, more popularly known as WYSINCO, in Spanish Town.\"She was very involved with homework, and so on, and she was extremely protective. During high school, she would wake up very early in the mornings to make sure that we had a proper, balanced breakfast,\" Devon reflected.Dwight, the fourth child, recalled that she was never quick to beat, but she got the message across.\"Whenever a certain time passed and she didn't see us come home from school, you would see her out there (at the gate) looking for us. She was always concerned and tried to instil discipline. She was strict, but she didn't beat. She talked, and we knew what she meant,\" Dwight explained.Even now, he said his mom has not shed her caring ways.\"Even as a big man, she would still wonder and worry about me. If she doesn't hear from me, she will call and find out if I am OK,\" said Dwight.SHOP OPERATORWith no special career goal in mind, while growing up in Cassava River in Glengoffe where she was born, Rose became a shop operator in 1951 after she and her husband relocated from Bamboo Corner, another area in the deep-rural farming community.\"At that time, you never have plenty shops. Now you have a lot more shops,\" she said.Her days of serving customers have brought her many happy moments. And even as her shop is not as stocked as it was in the past, she is still thankful that over the decades, she has managed to establish herself as an outstanding business woman.For Reynolds, bothered by pain which slows her down, \"I think I'm quite happy with my life now because when I look at myself coming up the ladder, I think I am quite satisfied,\" she said with a gratifying smile.Her husband is equally satisfied.\"She is a very loving wife. She takes care of me the best she can and she took care of her kids all right, and I am satisfied,\" said Leon.rural@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7489, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e78d9db5b8154ab", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:34.870", "title": "Outbreak!", "occurred_at": "2012-10-13T03:54:31", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121013/lead/lead1.html", "data": "Carl Gilchrist, Gleaner WriterCHAIRMAN OF the South East Regional Health Authority (SERHA), Lyttleton Shirley, says that overtime work and sessional duties are \"wrecking\" the island's nurses and doctors and compromising health-care delivery.As such, Shirley is urging a better way to rotate staff to help reduce the potential risk of fatigue, errors and high stress levels, among other things.Shirley was addressing the opening session of the 42nd island conference of the Nurses' Association of Jamaica (NAJ) at the Sunset Jamaica Grande Resort and Spa in Ocho Rios on Friday.\"We must start a self-examination and distribution of resources,\" Shirley suggested. \"Overtime and sessional duties are wrecking our nurses and our doctors and causing underlying compromised care to our patients.Late last year, former president of the Jamaica Medical Doctors' Association, Dayton Campbel, ignited a firestorm when he divulged that doctors at the Cornwall Regional Hospital had fallen over in the middle of surgery because they had been up the entire night operating as a result of inadequate staffing.Dr Campbell, now a member of parliament, had appeared before Parliament's Human Resource and Social Development Committee where he made the comment.At that time, the chairman of the Western Regional Health Authority, Noel Donaldson, had refuted claims that patient care at the Cornwall Regional Hospital was being compromised because of exhaustion among overworked doctors.Find better ways of rotating staffYesterday, Shirley told the gathering at the NAJ conference that \"we must find a better way of rotating our staff to help with the disparity of those who are working long hours, beyond their physical capacity to deliver quality care, in order to earn a larger pay cheque, as opposed to others who are working fewer hours and struggling to make ends meet.\"Certainly, this will reduce the potential risk of fatigue, errors, poor mannerism, poor communication, high stress levels, family dysfunctionality due to absenteeism, and subtle power play.\"Shirley also warned that some nurses and doctors who were not living up to the creed to which they had vowed must now be held accountable for equitable and proper patient care.According to Shirley: \"Some of the complaints we are getting from our patients are most disturbing and our legal department at the ministry and at the region is now inundated with lawsuits, many of which will end up as serious cases to be heard, with the possibility of large compensations being awarded.\"At the same time, Shirley acknowledged the tremendous contribution made by the island's nurses.\"Without a doubt, there are not many people whose lives have not been touched by the care and reassurance that nurses provide every hour of the day, every day of the year.\"Our nurses are there for our patients - to educate them, to counsel them, to encourage them and to comfort them above and beyond the technical care that is provided.\"Shirley congratulated the NAJ for \"the sterling role\" it continues to play in championing the rights of nurses.SERHA covers 10 hospitals, including Kingston Public, Bustamante for Children and Victoria Jubilee in the Corporate Area, Spanish Town in St Catherine and Princess Margaret in St Thomas.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7490, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/12db11829daff283", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:35.574", "title": "A dirty shame!", "occurred_at": "2012-10-13T03:54:31", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121013/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Adrian Frater, News EditorWestern Bureau:SOME SAY he was a good man who turned bad after he killed a man who was accused of murdering a member of his family.

I am not going to be part of any cover-up to conceal any information from the public. CAP has cost this country dearly and there is no information on CAP that must be kept out of the public view. Let the information be tabled and made public,\" Shaw charged during a meeting of the Public Administration and Appropriations Committee.The committee had invited the principals of CAP and permanent secretary in the Ministry of Science, Technology, Energy and Mining Hilary Alexander to provide an update on the Government's efforts to sell its 45 per cent shares in the company.Alexander told the committee that negotiations were continuing with Glencore and Alcoa to divest the Government's stake in Jamalco's alumina operations.No final position\"There is not a final position at this point in time. There is a draft asset-purchase agreement that has been submitted to Glencore now, and that is being reviewed,\" Alexander said, adding that the draft agreement was sent to Glencore last month.She said the draft asset-sale agreement now reflected settled positions on some of the outstanding issues such as alternate energy solutions.The sale of the Government's stake in the loss-making entity is one of the requirements to usher in a new International Monetary Fund agreement with the State.Meanwhile, Bartlett had informed members of the committee on Wednesday that he received a private report from CAP. He told his colleagues that he would send a copy to each member electronically.Said Bartlett: \"The only copy that would be available is the one I have, and we intend to treat with sensitive national issues in this way.\"A seemingly agitated Shaw had asked whether the report was private. Bartlett said the document contained certain types of information which, for the \"good order of governance, would not be made public\".He sought to explain that, if the document were released to the public, it might influence current negotiations which, according to Bartlett, \"might be injurious to the public good\".Shaw quickly dismissed Bartlett's argument, stating that \"what was harmful to the public was the amount of money that has had to be paid to keep up a faulty agreement that was entered into in 2004\".Attempting to give more details about the contents of the report, Bartlett said it had to do with strategic reserves in relation to bauxite.An unrelenting Shaw insisted that the document should be released to the press. \"Everything we deliberate here in this House is public business ... .

I think the Ministry of Health has to intensify its activities. As a physician in practice, I am seeing quite a few cases of people with dengue and people are complaining that there are still mosquito infestations in certain areas,\" Baugh told The Gleaner yesterday.His response came shortly after the ministry confirmed the outbreak of the illness with all parishes affected to date during the press conference held at the ministry's head offices in downtown Kingston.Baugh said the ministry's surveillance efforts have to be strengthened so that it can identify the areas where the vector mosquito is present in large numbers and to see to what extent it can be brought under control.\"It is still at a stage where it can be controlled, where the cycle can be broken and the epidemic can be brought under control, but the ministry does have to intensify its actions,\" he said.\"Fogging is good, yes, at a certain stage, but the way it is now they will have to do aerial spraying. If they wait too long, then the numbers will get too great,\" he said.Health Minister Fenton Ferguson said the ministry has committed a further $14 million to fight the spread of the illness in addition to almost $12 million that has already been spent on the dengue activities.He said the ministry has been undertaking major education campaigns, extensive fogging exercises and treatment and destruction of breeding sites in sections of the island.\"I want to assure the public that the ministry is doing all it can at this time to limit the impact of dengue fever on the population. We ask that you take your responsibility to search for and destroy breeding sites around your home seriously as this is the only way we can make any meaningful impact,\" he argued.Cases climbingMeanwhile, Director of Health Promotion and Protection, Dr Kevin Harvey, said special emphasis would be placed on the Corporate Area where the number of cases continues to climb.Of the suspected cases of dengue, close to half are reported to be in the Kingston and St Andrew area.He added that focus would also be placed on St Catherine and Manchester where the numbers are also high.\"We are intensifying our actions in Kingston and St Andrew, in particular, to try and make an impact and also in Manchester and St Catherine.\"Over the coming days, you will see an intensified activity within the Kingston and St Andrew area and increased fogging visits to your house in attempts to reduce the breeding sites,\" he said.nadisha.hunter@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7505, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0911aacdc187d078", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:55.593", "title": "Teen Musgrave medallist eyes business expansion", "occurred_at": "2012-10-12T03:16:22", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121011/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Livern Barrett, Gleaner WriterAt 14 years old, Richaydo Farquharson is rounding into a shrewd businessman.Not satisfied with producing 126 gallons of his branded Jamaica Gold honey three times a year, the teenager is now taking steps to expand his thriving bee farm.Farquharson operates 14 bee colonies from his home in Porus, Manchester, with help from his mother and nine-year-old sibling.As part of his diversification plan, Farquharson is now looking to begin the production of honey straw that will be marketed in schools and in his parish next year.In addition, he plans to use honeycombs to create a sampling of natural lotions, hair food and lip balm that could soon be added to his range of products.NOT AN EASY ROADBut for Farquharson, who is this year's Musgrave Youth Medal awardee for his entrepreneurship, it has not been easy.\"Sometimes it is stressful, but I just have to go with the flow,\" said the teenager, one of the 14 individuals and groups that were presented with their Musgrave Medals yesterday.Farquharson, who has received much-needed guidance and assistance from the Mutual Building Societies Foundation and the Digicel Foundation through their 'Young Entrepreneur: I am the Change' initiative, said he drew inspiration from his aunt.\"I see how I can make this better, so I went to the entrepreneur camp and that's where it all started,\" he explained.The Musgrave Medals, named after former Governor of Jamaica Sir Anthony Musgrave, are awarded each year in gold, silver and bronze to persons who have made significant contributions to the development of literature, science and the arts in Jamaica and the West Indies.Professors Horace Fletcher and Edward Baugh were this year's gold-medal awardees for their work in the fields of medical science and literature, respectively.The silver-medal awardees were Dr Pauline Christie for her work in the field of linguistics, Professor Bryan McFarlane for the arts, Emmanuel 'Rico' Rodriquez for music, John Henry Thompson for science, the Calabash International Literacy Festival for literature, and the Herbert Morrison Technical High School band for the training and development of music.The bronze-medal awardees were Dr Ellen Campbell-Grizzle for her work in the field of science, Arlene Patricia Ononaiwu for library development, Ebony Patterson for the arts, Dr Donald Shirley for music and the Poetry Society of Jamaica for its work in the field of literature.livern.barrett@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7506, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f0953f57227b4b3c", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:56.055", "title": "'Pryce needs to learn protocol'", "occurred_at": "2012-10-12T03:16:22", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121011/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Daraine Luton, Senior Staff ReporterFORMER PRIME Minister Edward Seaga yesterday issued a reprimand to North East St Elizabeth Member of Parliament (MP) Raymond Pryce, who it appeared did not stand to salute him during a special joint sitting of the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday.\"He must learn what protocol is all about and how protocol is applied,\" Seaga told The Gleaner yesterday.Pryce, a first-term MP, was observed sitting while other members of the legislature rose at the end of the special joint sitting to salute Seaga.The former prime minister, who served as MP for West Kingston from 1962 to 2005, said he learnt of Pryce's reported actions subsequent to the sitting.\"I did not see it.

The best strategy is to reserve energy for nearer to an election,\" argued Caine.His sentiments have been echoed by leaders in the JLP, who stressed that rather than incurring unnecessary expenses at this time, the focus must be on recreating and strengthening the party which suffered a massive beating in the 2011 general election last year at the hands of the now-governing People's National Party.\"For the JLP, this is a demonstration of the austerity that is needed in governance,\" one party stalwart, who asked that he not be identified, told The Gleaner. \"There is no point in any public display of support at this time. What is required is a sober reflection on the weaknesses in the party's positional structure and the serious economic challenges facing the country.\"The Gleaner was informed that the JLP Strategic Review Committee, which was commissioned by the party in the aftermath of its devastating election loss, would release its report for review ahead of the new format annual conference.Caine is of the view that the central issue influencing the conference is the consolidation of Andrew Holness' position as leader of the JLP.\"Mr Holness is going to have to consolidate his leadership of the party, which has been in some doubt - especially since the elections - in the minds and eyes of the public,\" Caine argued.gary.spaulding@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7510, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ff804740440b2b3f", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:57.919", "title": "Underutilised facilities put huge hole in UDC finances", "occurred_at": "2012-10-12T03:16:22", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121011/lead/lead7.html", "data": "Edmond Campbell, Senior Staff ReporterA STRING of loss-making entities have left the powerful state-owned Urban Development Corporation (UDC) haemorrhaging as the company struggles with a net operating loss of close to $490 million this year.Parliament's Public Administration and Appropriations Committee heard yesterday that the massive net operating loss was recorded for the period ended August 31, 2012.The company had budgeted for a net operating loss of $219 million.A major loss-making entity for the UDC is the Montego Bay Convention Centre in St James.UDC General Manager Desmond Malcolm said the centre was a huge drain on the operations, costing the UDC $300 million per annum.\"It is a beautiful centre. However, it is going to take a long time for us to realise profits. We are not going to give up,\" Malcolm told committee members.He said stakeholders in the hotel industry were working with the UDC to market the facility.The underutilised downtown Kingston bus park is also stressing the UDC. According to Malcolm, the bus park was costing the corporation $10 million per year with little revenue trickling in.He said attempts had been made to transfer the bus park to the Kingston and St Andrew Corporation. However, he said the UDC had to take back control of the park.\"We had to take possession to secure our investment. It's very unfortunate, but $10 million is what we have to be putting out now. We don't feel it's fair,\" Malcolm said.NON-PERFORMING ASSETSYesterday, the executive of the UDC appeared before the committee and was quizzed about a number of non-performing assets owned by the company.Committee member Mikael Phillips wanted to know what the UDC was doing about the Machado complex, purchased by the corporation in 2010 for $80 million. At the time of the purchase, it was proposed that the UDC would relocate its headquarters to the 3.5-acre complex located at 22-26 Victoria Avenue and South Camp Road.Questions were also raised about the JAMINTEL building on Duke Street in Kingston and the Cotton Polyester Mill in Old Harbour which is owned by the UDC.Raymond Pryce asked whether the UDC had purchased junk assets. Malcolm said he could not provide an answer at this time, but would carry out research to determine the rationale behind purchasing some of the assets.edmond.campbell@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7511, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/269a6440bac19bab", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:58.371", "title": "Jury selection problems irk lawyers", "occurred_at": "2012-10-12T03:16:22", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121011/lead/lead8.html", "data": "Barbara Gayle, Justice CoordinatorSome defence lawyers and prosecutors yesterday joined forces to criticise the authorities for their failure to take adequate steps to ensure that citizens are available for jury service.\"Many jurors would want to do their civic duty, but they just don't have lunch money or bus fare to attend court,\" prosecutor Michele Salmon said.The lawyers were voicing their disapproval of the fact that a murder case which was ready for trial had to be put off to January 7 next year because of insufficient jurors.Only 19 jurors were in attendance and at least 26 jurors should have been in attendance for jury selection.Twelve jurors are required to try a murder case, but after nine jurors were selected yesterday at the Home Circuit Court, no other jurors were available.Defence lawyers Vincent Wellesley and Latoya Errar, who are representing the accused, Stacey Ann Forsythe, told The Gleaner their client was very disappointed that her case could not proceed. Forsythe has been before the court since 2010 and yesterday was the third trial date. She is on bail.Wellesley said the problem with jurors was not a legal problem but a political one. He said nothing could be done about the jury problem unless policymakers do something about it. ONE-WEEK STRIKEHe said he was going to ask his colleagues to remain out of court for one week because the jury problem was affecting the progress of cases that were ready for trial. He also commented on the huge backlog of cases which were being traversed term after term.Prosecutor Sahai Whittingham Maxwell said the $500 given daily to jurors who actually serve was not enough, adding that they had to wait for months before they were reimbursed.Whittingham Maxwell said the courts outside Kingston faced similar problems with shortages of jurors and that some of the jurors just could not find bus fare and lunch money to attend court when summoned.barbara.gayle@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7512, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8e95c5cdc969d64c", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:58.810", "title": "Bebe's case put off until next year", "occurred_at": "2012-10-12T03:16:22", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121011/lead/lead9.html", "data": "WESTERN BUREAU:Popular Montego Bay political activist Kenrick 'Bebe' Stephenson, who was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of property and illegal abstraction of electricity by the Lottery Scam Task Force earlier this year, has had the case against him put off until next year.When he appeared in the Montego Bay Resident Magistrate's Court yesterday, Stephenson, who is being represented by attorney-at-law Nicole Allen, was told to return for trial on January 16, 2013.When the case was called up, the court was told that the prosecution was in the process of trying to get an employee from the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) to give evidence against Stephenson.The case against Stephenson stems from an incident on Saturday, May 19 when the task force, which was carrying out targeted operations in St James and Hanover, raided Stephenson's Coral Gardens home and arrested him for unlawful possession of property and illegal abstraction, among other charges.christopher.thomas@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7558, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/27e4089cb13272fe", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:22.012", "title": "Cabinet reshuffle not the answer - Civil voices say changes needed in governance, not personnel", "occurred_at": "2012-10-08T04:18:41", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121007/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Daraine Luton, Senior Staff ReporterCIVIL SOCIETY leaders have said no to the calls for Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller to quickly reshuffle the Cabinet she appointed in January.Addressing a Gleaner Editors' Forum at the company's North Street, Kingston, offices last week, Carol Narcisse, chairperson of the Jamaica Civil Society Coalition (JCSC), said the focus must be about good governance and not the persons in ministerial positions.\"We have a responsibility as media and as civil society. We cannot make the people of this country think that to go back to doing it as was done in the previous administration, where we changed how many ministers of national security in three years [is the answer],\" said Narcisse.In the last administration, then Prime Minister Bruce Golding replaced Derrick Smith as national security minister after eight months with Colonel Trevor MacMillan.The latter was subsequently replaced by Dwight Nelson, who held office until the change of political administration in January.But Christopher Zacca, president of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica (PSOJ) and member of the JCSC, told the Editors' Forum that Jamaica must develop the culture of firing non-performing ministers.\"One of the few constitutional levers we have in effecting good executive leadership is firing a man or woman from the Cabinet.\"I think it is something that is not done enough, and frankly, when it is done, a lot of times there is just some shifting rather than outright expulsion,\" said Zacca, even as he refused to weigh in on whether the time has come for Simpson Miller to shake up her Cabinet.ADDRESS GOVERNANCE ISSUESZacca, however, joined hands with other members of civil society who said addressing governance issues is critical for the country to prosper.Narcisse pointed to the need to implement various aspects of security reform, which has been lagging for years.\"It goes beyond Bunting or whoever,\" said Narcisse.\"You have a set of policies and programmes you want to see done, they don't happen in five years, you remove them. We need to set the bar high so it is beyond individuals in chairs. It's policy implementation.\"She argued that the Jamaican electorate must become impatient with governments.\"So, like how we have one spending only one term, that is the pattern that must occur.\"The Jamaica Labour Party was booted from office after one term by voters last December. It was the first time in Jamaica's history that a political party had been rejected after only one term.Trevor Munroe, head of National Integrity Action, refused to be drawn into a call for Cabinet reshuffle.He said critical governance issues, such as campaign finance reform, have been agreed on but have not been followed through.\"That has to do not with any single member of the Cabinet that we don't have campaign-finance reform,\" he said.EFFECT FUNDAMENTAL REFORMSMunroe pointed to the perception of rampant levels of corruption and said successive governments have not done enough to effect fundamental governance reforms.\"(Contractor General) Greg Christie made 50-odd special investigations in his tenure. A number of them found there was nothing; others did. There has been one prosecution - Kern Spencer.\"Three-plus years ago it started, three witnesses of 27 have been heard; the man who stole ackee gets three months, a conviction upheld by the appeal court,\" added Munroe.Spencer, a former state minister, was arrested in 2008 and charged with corruption and money laundering.The charges arose out of his alleged mishandling of the Cuban light bulb programme, from which, the Crown alleges, he improperly benefited. The case has been stalled in the court.On the other hand, Junior Christie, 30, was sentenced to three months by Senior Magistrate Judith Pusey after he pleaded guilty to praedial larceny. He stole 45 pods of ackees from the grounds of King's House last November.The appeal court last month rejected his appeal to have the conviction overturned.\"What is that telling you? This has nothing to do with who in the Cabinet should stay or who should go. It has to do with fundamental issues of governance,\" said Munroe.He continued: \"You have a Parliament that meets 45 afternoons per year. Sixty-three people on full-time pay and you have an average legislative agenda of 120 different items.\"At the end of each legislative year, you get 25 or 30 bills passed. My focus is on the governance issues rather than who should stay or go from the Cabinet. We have had Cabinet ministers come and Cabinet ministers go.\"That is a view that is shared by the Reverend Dr Paul Gardner, immediate past president of the Jamaica Council of Churches, and Robert Stephens of Jamaica United for Sustainable Development.RESHUFFLING WON'T LEAD TO CHANGEAs Stephens puts it, \"Reshuffling the deck of cards is not going to make any difference unless those fundamental issues are addressed.\"Similarly, Gardner said, \"The fundamental issue is not about reshuffling a Cabinet member.\"According to Gardner, a Cabinet reshuffle would not give Jamaica the traction it needs in terms of governance issues.\"The legislative agenda is out of whack in terms of what is to be done. Our parliamentarians are not focused on their core responsibilities, which are to legislate, to deal with policies. Therefore, our responsibility is having them refocused.\"Opposition Leader Andrew Holness has so far refused to comment on whether the time has come for a Cabinet reshuffle.But Floyd Green, president of Generation 2000, the young professional affiliate of the Jamaica Labour Party, wants to see the back of Peter Bunting, who heads the national security ministry.\"The prime minister should reassess her appointment of Peter Bunting as minister of national security, as within the past 10 months, the only piece of legislation he has brought to the House is the traffic ticket amnesty,\" said Green.daraine.luton@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7559, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/166c8474e881ce48", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:22.479", "title": "No free ride for the PNP - Civil groups reject claim that they have gone silent since the JLP ousting", "occurred_at": "2012-10-08T04:18:41", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121007/lead/lead4.html", "data": "The Jamaica Civil Society Coalition (JCSC) is rubbishing claims that it is giving the People's National Party (PNP) administration an easy ride.The JCSC, which counts among its members several influential non-governmental organisations, has faced criticisms in recent weeks that it has gone silent in the wake of the PNP's victory in the 2011 general election, after being very strident while the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) formed the government.\"I am appalled that to date I hear very little from the same civil society and the media, which were so vocal under the last government,\" argued one writer to The Gleaner recently.\"What has happened to the Jamaica Civil Society Coalition, the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce, the Jamaica Council of Churches, the National Integrity Action, the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Alliance, ... etc?\" added the letter writer as he echoed a view often stated by Delano Seiveright, former head of the JLP affiliate, Generation 2000.But last week, members of the JCSC used a Gleaner Editors' Forum to scoff at the claim, even as they admitted that some key voices now speaking out in civil society came from a PNP-aligned background.\"It's an understandable criticism because a number of those of us in civil society have come from the left, if you want. Let's admit that openly because I certainly did,\" declared JCSC member Horace Levy, who represents the Peace Management Initiative.\"Perhaps we have given them a little breathing space since they have just come into office, but we are not letting them up in the least,\" added Levy as he pointed to the recent open letter from the JCSC to Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller.\"We are not letting them off the hook. We have not indulged in any vitriol or any attacks because that's just not our style.\"ENGAGED IN PRIVATELevy was supported by JCSC chairperson Carol Narcisse, who argued that over the past nine months, much of the engagement with the Simpson Miller administration has taken place outside of the public glare and at several levels.\"One is the public advocacy which you will see in things like open letters and press releases, but the other level at which we work is directly with ministries, departments and agencies,\" said Narcisse.\"So [when] an issue arises, we invite the relevant minister to speak with us about what the Government's plans are, and we assemble civil society organisation, in particular those organisations that have an expertise in the issue that minister is addressing,\" added Narcisse.She pointed to the major fire at the Riverton City landfill in February, and noted that after a member of the JCSC, the Jamaica Environmental Trust (JET), wrote to the ministries involved and received no response, the coalition put its muscle behind the organisation and sent off a letter signed by representatives of several organisations.According to Narcisse, that letter was responded to by all three government ministers involved and the JCSC subsequently met with the ministers and outlined the proposals which had been developed by JET.\"We are taking an approach that says the advocacy is important, the public pronouncements are important, but at the end of the day, you have to do the work that is necessary. Put forward what is the alternative you are calling for and then hold those ministries, department and agencies to account ... .\"The Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica (PSOJ) also scoffed at the claim that it has relaxed its watchdog role because the PNP now forms the government.\"Our advocacy position has always been what is good for growth in Jamaica, regardless of which party is in power, and we have always taken the position that there is a place for policy formation, a place for discussion and behind-the-scenes lobbying ... and there is a place for speaking out when we have hit a brick wall.\"I will think that if you look at the PSOJ's approach across all administrations, our position has remained fairly constant,\" said Chris Zacca, PSOJ president.arthur.hall@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7560, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/19b3cdb839b61968", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:23.866", "title": "Betting and gaming agency's gamble - Two years and $240 million later, commission yet to move to new Hagley Park Road property", "occurred_at": "2012-10-07T04:12:51", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121007/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Tyrone Reid, Senior Staff ReporterAfter spending just under $61 million in mortgage payments over the past two years, the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Commission (BGLC) is yet to move into its Hagley Park Road building which it purchased for $240 million.The commission is still stuck at its Ruthven Road headquarters, which it has long outgrown while the building metres from Half-Way Tree in St Andrew remains unoccupied.Derek Peart, executive director of the BGLC, told The Sunday Gleaner that the commission had planned to move into its new home by June 2012 after the October- 2010 purchase.But, after a few hiccups in the process to get the building ready, that date has been pushed back to March 2013.Back in November 2010, the purchase was the source of indignation for some members of Parliament's Public Administration and Appropriations Committee.The members questioned how the then Bruce Golding-led Cabinet could sanction a purchase that seemingly contradicted its commitment to move its agencies and departments to downtown, Kingston in a bid to resuscitate the heart of the capital city.Last week, Peart explained that delays in the procurement process and the workload of the project managers - the National Works Agency (NWA) - were largely responsible for the setback.\"I think some of it might have been because of the NWA - the project manager - (was) undertaking several other projects,\" said Peart.The BGLC head said he understands the NWA's position because some of what it had to respond to were bonafide exigencies.\"Even with the (recent) flooding ... I can't argue with a quantity surveyor who has to go deal with a blocked road,\" said Peart.Commission's misfortunesHe admitted that he did not foresee the commission's misfortunes when the purchase was made back in 2010.\"Not to the length of time it is taking, I must admit that. The time value of money is a factor ... if you are six months behind schedule there is a cost,\" said Peart, while adding that the BGLC was abiding by every letter of the Government's procurement law.\"It is a source of disappointment on our part because the relocation has implications for several (capital) projects,\" said Peart.He told our news team that work on the roof of the Hagley Park Road building had to be re-tendered recently because of a variance between the comparable estimate and the actual pricing in the bid.\"The GOJ (Government of Jamaica) procurement guidelines require an estimate of the cost of proposed works as part of the procurement process.\"When bids are submitted they have two separate components - technical and financial ... in this particular case, the contractor was found to be suitable but pricing was found to be more than 15 per cent above the comparable estimate which is not allowed by the guidelines,\" explained Peart.A new request for proposal for the roof has been advertised and bids are being submitted, said the BGLC head.So far, the State's betting, gaming and lotteries regulator has spent just under $12 million on refurbishing work at 78 Hagley Park Road which once housed Shirlhome Chemicals.Peart said he could not provide the total to be spent on the project because the tender process was not complete.However, Peart revealed that the BGLC plans to sell its old headquarters as soon as it moves into its new Hagley Park Road home.At the time of the purchase, the BGLC paid down $100 million and took out a $140-million vendor's mortgage at a rate of 16 per cent over seven years.The monthly payment then was $2.78 million. In August this year, the Commission made a lump-sum payment of $60 million on the mortgage leaving a balance of $58 million to be repaid over five years at $1.2 million each month.Despite the delays, Peart expressed no regret over the purchase.The BGLC boss said he is confident the performance level of his team will improve with the move to its new headquarters because all its administrative functions will be centralised on one building as opposed to the three separate buildings the commission operates out of at the Ruthven Road premises.\"We are in a situation where we are literally tumbling over each other and that affects the level of productivity and the comfort of the staff. We have communicated with the staff asking for patience,\" said Peart.In 2010, when news of the BGLC's purchase was first announced, Peart had declared that the Commission had been seeking a new home since 1995.tyrone.reid@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7513, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88748b9a650b70d5", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:47:59.262", "title": "It's not crazy to show love to mentally ill", "occurred_at": "2012-10-12T03:16:22", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121011/lead/lead91.html", "data": "Float parade educates public on importance of care A Zoukie Trucking trailer touring the Corporate Area is not unusal, but this one was bearing a different message.Staff of the Community Mental Health Services toured sections of Kingston and St Andrew, starting in Seaview Gardens, teaching the public about mental health and how to prevent mental illness.They handed out flyers and had question-and-answer sessions with curious passers-by yesterday, which was observed  as World Mental Health Day.

However, this time his recommendation has resurfaced at a time when the Jamaican dollar is sliding as it comes under intense pressure, reaching a record $90.32 to the US dollar.Addressing a joint sitting of the Upper and Lower Houses of Parliament yesterday, Seaga said the move to peg the Jamaican dollar to the US dollar would reduce inflation to minimal levels and lower the \"still high interest on commercial loan rates of financial institutions to business-friendly levels\".Further, the former head of government said this decision would reduce expenditure in the cost of servicing external debt and make payments on interest, profit and dividends earned by overseas investment and reducing the stock of debt.MASSIVE INFLOWSA pegged exchange rate, according to Seaga, would also open the door for potential massive inflows of low-interest foreign exchange for mortgage financing and investment since the risk of devaluation or depreciation of the rate of exchange would no longer exist.\"This would be revolutionary for attracting low-cost funds for agriculture, education, infrastructure and low-cost housing, creating thousands of new jobs,\" he added.\"Most of all, it would restore the economic growth which has been stagnant for two decades because the increased prices which follow devaluations would cease, ensuring that none of the substance of growth would be extracted from the GDP (gross domestic product) to pay the higher prices of devaluations,\" Seaga asserted.Situated on the coastline of the world's richest economy, the former prime minister told parliamentarians that Jamaica had no reason to be poor.He argued that Jamaica's strategic location creates a centre of preference for the island to exploit in developing or finishing products from the Far East (China, India) South America (Brazil) and even Europe utilising negotiated tax relief benefits of the Caribbean Basin Initiative for duty-free export to the US market.\"For years, I have been promoting this idea, based on reclaiming land in Kingston Harbour at Fort Augusta,\" he said.According to Seaga the proposal, whether at Fort Augusta or Caymanas, made sense in the same way that the development of a massive garment industry complex was established in the 1980s for exporting goods manufactured by Hong Kong firms in Jamaica, creating more than 40,000 new jobs. The initiative became a huge foreign exchange earner for the economy.Prior to Seaga's first presentation in Gordon House since retiring from active politics in 2005, parliamentarians yesterday showered accolades on the former prime minister for his contributions to Jamaica over more than four decades.Among those paying tribute were Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller who called Seaga \"one of the granite figures of our time\", and West Kingston Member of Parliament Desmond McKenzie who said there was \"no single politician in this country who can claim the love, affection, dedication and commitment of his constituency like the people of west Kingston to The Most Honourable Edward Phillip George Seaga\".Seaga, who represented West Kingston throughout his time in Parliament, was a mentor to McKenzie and remains a revered figure in the constituency.edmond.campbell@gleanerjm.comWest Portland MP Daryl Vaz: He is the most outstanding parliamentarian... .

So if more people get involved the better ... . We have a tendency to think that solutions will happen if someone else brings them about,\" added Narcisse.She noted that Jamaica has a long history of people organising themselves to make a difference, and that is needed now more than ever.\"We see things getting to a period that is crisis driven; as they are, I think the time has come for us to step up not just the response in terms of practical interventions ... what's needed now are more voices, both individual and organisations, that are dealing with lobbying and advocacy.\"She argued that more Jamaicans need to be prepared to take on the elected representatives who have been given the job of setting policy for the country's affairs.WE'RE ALL TEAM JAMAICAThat is a view shared by president of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica, Christopher Zacca, who charged that everyone has to see themselves as part of 'Team Jamaica'.According to Zacca, 'Team Jamaica' must take the blame for the failure of the country to achieve an acceptable level of economic growth over the past 50 years.Immediate past president of the Jamaica Council of Churches, the Reverend Dr Paul Gardener, agreed that civil society needs to do more to make Jamaica a better place.\"I would say that there is so much more that civil society can do. There is always room for improvement, but one has to look at the things that civil society has done over the years,\" Gardener told the Editors' Forum, as other participants agreed.\"While I blame the political parties for the mess that Jamaica is in for the past many decades, I also have to blame civil society for allowing them to do it,\" said Horace Levy of the Peace Management Initiative.Levy argued that the events leading to the west Kingston incursion by the security force in May 2010 underscores the strength of civil society in Jamaica.\"While credit goes to the extradition request from the United States, civil society played a key role, and that incursion was a turning point for Jamaica,\" said Levy.\"It was somewhat negative in terms of the massacre that took place, and positive as an assertion of the central authority of the Jamaican people,\" declared Levy as he added his voice for more Jamaicans to come off their verandas.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7519, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/30b2655725a8ff13", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:02.184", "title": "Approval for retaining wall at Sandy Gully leaves officials scratching heads", "occurred_at": "2012-10-12T03:16:22", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121010/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Nedburn Thaffe, Gleaner WriterThe retaining wall of an apartment complex in Liguanea, St Andrew, which has rendered a section of the Sandy Gully unstable, has raised concern about how the construction received approval from the Kingston and St Andrew Corporation (KSAC).Yesterday, Richard Azan, state minister in the Ministry of Transport, Works and Housing, who went on a tour in the area along with a technical team, said it was clear the wall was in breach of the building code.Azan said the KSAC should play a part in the repair work at the site as, \"from observing the wall it is quite heavy and that has helped to contribute to the problem that we are having here\".Communication manager at the National Works Agency Stephen Shaw, who was also on the tour, later made it clear that the apartment buildings behind the wall did not themselves seem to be in breach of the code which stipulates that construction should take place at least 15 feet away from gullies.\"Certainly the building itself looks like it adheres to that minimum, but the retaining wall seems to be in breach. But that is something that the Town and Country Planning Authority will have to look at,\" Shaw said.RESIDENTS HAVE TO ASSISTAzan disclosed that residents occupying the complex might have to assist in whatever way possible to minimise the damage being done to the gully.\"There are some pipes from the apartment buildings that lead to the gully and I think that is contributing to the problem that we are having here,\" Azan said. \"We need to have some discussion with the owners of the property ... they have to help in some way to control the waste water from their property.\"In the meantime, Azan said repairs to the Sandy Gully could cost the Government more than $300 million, up from initial estimates.\"We had an estimate before and since the rain, further damage (has been done) so it will cost us more. The first estimate (which looks at the entire gully), I think it was over $195 million but as you can observe that it is not $195 million anymore, it is running in about $300-and-odd million,\" Azan declared yesterday.The state minister said that, based on what was observed, the ministry would treat the need for repairs as an emergency case to get work started in the shortest possible time.\"What I observed from our visit here today has to be a really serious emergency in order to save life and property around here. We have to fast track all that is on the books to get work started.

As a result, they say they have been left with no choice other than to depend on the mercy of the authorities who made promises to repair the area in the wake of the tragic event.More than two years have now passed and nothing has been done. The residents have become infuriated and are now chastising authorities for feeding them with empty promises, even as history seems bound to repeat itself.Checks in the area yesterday showed that the section of the gully that gave way in 2010 has remained untouched. Heavy shrubbery now masks the spot where the five fell to their deaths, but a flight of steps serves as a vivid reminder that there lies the remains of what used to be a home for the family of five.\"When the people dem wash weh every big shot come here and talk seh them a go repair it. From that time until now, see it deh. All now dem nuh do nothing to it. All of us here are under danger,\" said a furious Camelia Sealy, yesterday when a team of government officials went on a tour of the area.The situation in the community has worsened over the past few days as a section of the retaining wall, which shoulders an apartment complex, has collapsed under the pressure. This latest case has heightened concerns of both residents and authorities who are fearing the worst.\"A right here so most of us use to get to our houses so what would happen if it break away in the heavy rain? Most of us would be marooned,\" reasoned 70-year-old Lloyd Johnson as he pointed to the breakaway section of a retaining wall.\"The hole in the gully is about five feet, six inches deep and nobody not doing anything. Is pure promise. We need somebody to come do something about it instead of promise,\" Johnson added.His plea was backed up by a number of residents who turned out to lend their voices to the cry while threatening to take to the streets in the coming week if something is not done.Akera Johnson, an expectant mother, said it was just on Sunday night that she and her family of eight had to get out of bed in the middle of the night to seek higher ground during the heavy rain. She said since the incident, the family members have not slept comfortably in their beds during heavy rains.\"Mi live right next door to the people dem weh wash weh.

Why don't you check The Gleaner online for photos of attire at past ceremonies?You may have heard persons cheering as the MC announces popular awardees. But that shouldn't happen. There should only be general applause at the end of every category of honour or award. So for example, if 55 persons became members of the Order of Distinction, the applause should come after the last person collects. Cellphones?

Mindful of the unease, Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller signalled to Nicholson to let it rest and he obliged.Norman Manley and Sir Alexander Bustamante are widely accepted as the forefathers of Jamaica's Independence. The country gained Independence in 1962 from Britain.Manley was a strong advocate for the Federation of the West Indies which was established in 1958. However, Bustamante and the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) opposed it. Manley called for a referendum to let the people decide. The vote was decisively against Jamaica's continued membership in the Federation.Manley, after arranging Jamaica's orderly withdrawal from the union, set up a joint committee to decide on a constitution for separate Independence for Jamaica.Seaga is the only surviving member of that constitutional committee out of which the new Jamaica was born.daraine.luton@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7562, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/946008b49d904824", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:24.961", "title": "Mandeville still safe - Cops, residents not worried despite recent attention-grabbing crime reports", "occurred_at": "2012-10-07T04:12:51", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121007/lead/lead7.html", "data": "Erica Virtue, Senior Gleaner WriterThe police are moving to assure residents of Mandeville and adjoining communities in Manchester that the area remains safe despite several recent front-page-grabbing crime reports.The killing of two prominent doctors, a number of robberies and other shootings have left some individuals frightened, but the cops argue that residents of the once-sleepy town are not paralysed by this fear.\"It is important that we make a distinction between crime and the fear of crime,\" said Assistant Commissioner of Police Derrick Cochrane, who heads Area Three which covers St Elizabeth, Clarendon and Manchester.\"Yes, there is crime, but importantly, the fear of crime is not paralysing people, preventing them from going about their day-to-day business,\" argued Cochrane.He noted that some communities in Manchester are on the police's radar.These include Comfort, Settlement, Barnstable, Top Greenvale, Bottom Greenvale, Knockpatrick, Waltham, Royal Flat and Georges Valley.Pointing to the July murder of well-known radiologist, Dr Phillip Chamberlain, among other recent crimes, Cochrane claimed that many of the criminals operating in the parish are not residents.\"We do not have the problem with gangs which leads to the multiple murders on the scale of a Spanish Town (St Catherine) or Kingston,\" said Cochrane.\"But the police can't be everywhere.

Tell a neighbour, tell the police,\" he suggested.Mandeville, which has long been a haven for returning residents, now enjoys a robust night-life, evidenced by the large numbers of locals and foreigners spotted by a Sunday Gleaner team at several nightspots last week.No worriesSupporting Cocrhane's claim that Mandeville is still safe, some business operators and residents told The Sunday Gleaner team that in spite of the recent crimes they are not worried.\"Yes, it is a safe town, but it is not the sleepy town we once knew. Mandeville has seen significant commercial changes over the last 20 years, and with that comes some antisocial behaviour,\" said Dwight Newman, businessman and resident of Mandeville.Newman lived in the town as a youngster while attending school, before leaving for some 20 years.He returned to Mandeville just over a year ago to start a business and has made property just outside the town his place of rest.\"There is growing indiscipline in the town, caused by pedestrians and drivers alike, that has caused a lot of delays just getting by,\" said Newman.The congestion Newman sees on the streets has forced police patrolling the area to be largely on foot, as response teams are likely to be caught in the heavy traffic if they drive.While Dave Beadle, business operator in Willogate Plaza, agrees that there is a high visibility of the police in the town, he charged that the plazas are the scenes of undisciplined behaviour, especially by schoolchildren.\"I have to personally run the students from off the plaza's in the evenings. It's a congregation point for students, and all kinds of inappropriate behaviours are carried out here.\"It's part of a general indecency in the society and it is here. It's inescapable,\" said Beadle as he pointed to the indiscipline of taxi operators in the town.Willowgate Plaza has become overrun by taxi drivers who ignore the municipal parking lot provided, and instead stop anywhere in the town for passengers.The young businessman said with more than 20 plazas now in the town, more and more traffic, vehicular and pedestrian, fight for the same space in the small town, and congestion is chronic, especially at peak hours.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7563, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b4b132fa5a99b394", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:25.462", "title": "New Zealand offers trade opportunities", "occurred_at": "2012-10-07T04:12:51", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121007/lead/lead8.html", "data": "Daraine Luton, Senior Staff ReporterWITH NEW ZEALAND being a powerhouse in the marketing of dairy products world-wide, Murray McCully, the foreign affairs and sports minister of the south Pacific country says there are opportunities for players in Jamaica to become part of that huge supply chain.\"We produce 2.5 per cent of the world's dairy product, yet we market well over one-third of the world's dairy products because we are involved in partnerships in many countries now producing for markets we are in.\"We are in the supply chain but the production is increasingly done offshore,\" McCully told The Sunday Gleaner last week.The minister, who visited Jamaica for bilateral talks with Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller, said that as part of New Zealand's international expansion of its agriculture, \"there are partnerships that we can embark on.\"He said the partnerships \"will no doubt be worked out between our private-sector players\" while adding that the role of the Government is limited to creating an enabling environment to foster collaboration.McCully said collaboration between private-sector entities is important to economic growth.He said his country, for example, is coming to terms with the fact that it is a global agriculture player.\"New Zealand has been very fortunate as for many decades we struggled from being the offshore farm for Great Britain. We worried about how we could be competitive in a market that was half-way around the world.

In fact, the case will now be tried as part of a 'remnant sitting' - a special sitting where matters not dealt with during the main schedule of the Michaelmas session are dealt with.Regisford was initially charged with kidnapping along with 23-year-old cabinetmaker Jonathan 'Clevaugn' Mitchell of Spaldings, Manchester; 22-year-old barber Trevon Tomlinson of Cornwall Courts, Montego Bay; and a 17-year-old minor of Paradise, in Montego Bay, in connection with the abduction of a 3-year-old child from the Mount Alvernia Preparatory School on May 3, 2011.However, while the other three defendants pleaded guilty to child-stealing when they appeared in court on September 24, Regisford declared that she was innocent of the charges and, as a consequence, she will face trial. The other three persons are slated for sentencing on October 17.When Regisford appeared in court, lead prosecutor Jeremy Taylor asked that the defendant be given a new trial date before another judge, on the grounds that presiding High Court magistrate, Martin Gayle, is to conduct sentencing on Mitchell, Tomlinson and the minor.Sense of fairness\"Having considered the matter, the three co-defendants that have pleaded guilty have not yet been sentenced. Out of an abundance of caution, and so that a sense of fairness may be seen, I would ask that the matter be set for the next sitting,\" said Taylor.\"Ms Regisford... the 4th December for your trial,\" Judge Gayle informed the defendant, after conferring with the prosecutor for a potential date.At the end of the court proceedings, defence lawyer Martyn Thomas, who is representing Regisford, said he agreed with the prosecution's stance, citing the need for impartiality in dealing with his client's trial and the sentencing of her former co-accused. christopher.thomas@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7564, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/05baf17ed368c0d5", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:25.979", "title": "The art of guessing who will win a Nobel Prize", "occurred_at": "2012-10-07T04:12:51", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121007/lead/lead9.html", "data": "STOCKHOLM (AP):Guessing who will win a Nobel Prize is a bit like forecasting the stock market: Experts don't seem to do it any better than laymen.So if you hear professors and pundits predicting the 'God particle' will be the theme of the physics prize next week, or that an American writer - finally - is due for the literature award, check their track record.\"My top candidate has never won, and it's the fourth year I do it now,\" admitted Norwegian peace researcher Kristian Harpviken, one of the most prominent voices in the annual guessing game for the Nobel Peace Prize.A week ahead of that announcement, the Irish online betting agency Paddy Power gave the lowest odds Friday to retired American scholar Gene Sharp, Afghan women's rights activist Sima Samar and Tunisian blogger Lina Ben Mhenni. All have been among Harpviken's top picks in recent years.Harpviken, who heads the PRIO peace institute in Oslo, admits his speculation is just that - speculation - based on current events, previous prizes and personal preference.The secretive prize committees rarely drop any hints and Harpviken doesn't have any inside information. Virtually none of the Nobel guess-makers do - but that doesn't stop them from trying.The peace and literature prizes generate the strongest buzz, and are typically less difficult to predict than the awards for chemistry, physics, medicine and economics.A prize a dayThe six award committees will announce one prize a day, starting with medicine tomorrow and ending with the economics award on October 15. The Nobel Foundation this year lowered the prize money 20 per cent to 8 million Swedish kronor (US$1.2 million), citing turmoil on financial markets. All prizes will be handed out on December 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's death in 1896.It would have been easier to guess the winners if the Nobel committees had stuck to the will of the Swedish industrialist, who wanted the annual awards to reflect the greatest achievements \"during the preceding year\". Instead, the Nobel statutes were changed so that committees can reward discoveries made decades ago, to make sure they have stood the test of time.\"I think Alfred would have been OK with that,\" said Per Carlson, a former chairman of the physics prize committee.Handing out a prize too soon increases the risk of jurors failing to identify the right scientists behind a discovery, Carlson said.That happened in 1974, when the Nobel Prize in physics went to British radio astronomers Sir Martin Ryle and Antony Hewish. The latter was cited for the discovery of pulsars - rotating neutron stars - though it later became clear that one of his graduate students deserved the credit.The Nobel time lag could hurt the chances of the most talked-about scientific breakthrough this year: the identification of the Higgs boson, a subatomic particle also referred to as the 'God particle'.Though British scientist Peter Higgs predicted the existence of the particle in the 1960s, it was only in July this year that scientists at an atom-smasher outside Geneva claimed to have identified it.Revealed after 50 yearsWhether Higgs was even nominated is unclear - the deadline was in February and nominations are not revealed for 50 years.Secrecy is paramount to the Nobel committees. Literature jurors have been known to use code words when discussing Nobel candidates and using fake book covers when reading their work.After suspected leaks ahead of recent announcements, the literature panel has taken additional measures this year. A press release declaring the winner will no longer be delivered by courier to the offices of major news organisations in Stockholm, including The Associated Press. And the panel's permanent secretary, Peter Englund, has stopped giving his customary interviews in the weeks leading up to the prize.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7539, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1a892044f0b052d3", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:12.387", "title": "Jamaican cops don't know ganja farmer in Ghana", "occurred_at": "2012-10-10T06:40:01", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121009/lead/lead91.html", "data": "Local law enforcement officials say they have not been briefed by their counterparts in Ghana on the arrest of a Jamaican man accused of being the mastermind behind the largest drug find in the African country.However one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that the Ghana Police Service was not required to notify Jamaican authorities since the accused, 58-year-old Wesley Appleton, had migrated to the African nation.\"They can as a matter of courtesy, depending on the man's antecedents there ... but we haven't heard from them at all,\" the official said.The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) of the Ghana Police Service has alleged that Appleton was behind the cultivation of some 400 acres of cannabis at Koru in the Alavanyo-Nkonya District in the Volta Region.Director general of the CID, Ghana's Commissioner of Police Prosper Agblor, said the farm was the largest ever in the country's history.The police say they also seized five home-made firearms, which were unlicensed, and close to five tonnes of cannabis that were harvested and stored in fertiliser bags and plastic drums in the cottage where Appleton was held.Agblor said the Jamaican, who migrated to Ghana in 2004, first landed on the police radar in 2010 when the CID gathered intelligence indicating that he had acquired a large portion of land in the Alavanyo-Nkonya area and was cultivating cannabis on a large scale for export.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7540, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d32ae53567f7e8a9", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:13.652", "title": "The ackee controversy - fact and fiction", "occurred_at": "2012-10-08T04:18:41", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121009/lead/lead92.html", "data": "THE BOTANICAL name of Jamaica's national fruit, the ackee is Blighia sapida.According to Wikipedia, this scientific name honours Captain William Bligh, a famous English sailor who took the fruit from Jamaica to the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, England in 1793, where it was introduced to science. It is originally from West Africa and is related to the lychee fruit. The common name is derived from the West African name, Akye fufo.Although very popular and widely used, many misconceptions and fictions still surround the consumption of this fruit.ACKEE - NUTRITION FACTSServing size 3.5 oz.

This is absolutely erroneous.Research from the Department of Biochemistry, University of the West Indies, Mona, found 51 to 58 per cent of the dry weight of ackee was lipid (fat), with linoleic, palmitic and stearic acids, very healthy fats, being the major fatty acids present.According to The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), ackee is a good source of these beneficial fats and provides an excellent source of fatty acids in the traditional Jamaican diet.I again remind readers of a basic fact: cholesterol is found only in foods of animal origin, as plants do not make this substance. There is, therefore, no cholesterol at all in ackees or, for that matter, in avocados, coconuts, peanuts or cashews.Ackee poisoningThe consumption of the unripe ackee fruit can create a condition known in Jamaica as ackee poisoning. This problem was first noted in 1875 and documented in 1904 when doctors labelled it the 'Jamaican vomiting sickness'. Substances in the under-ripe pods (and the ackee seeds) cause severe vomiting that can lead to convulsions, coma and death. PAHO confirms what Jamaican researchers had identified: that two amino acids hypoglycin A and hypoglycin B cause the fruit to be toxic.They were given these names because of their ability to cause hypoglycemia - a severe lowering of blood-sugar levels. The hypoglycin content rapidly diminishes after sunlight reaches the mature open pods. Before effective treatments were developed, the mortality rate for ackee poisoning was as high as 80 per cent. In Jamaica today, with increased awareness and prompt treatment, deaths are infrequent. Only six deaths were reported here from 1989 to 1991.Ackee and the prostateThere is a belief being circulated that eating ackee is bad for the prostate. Some even suggest that it may cause prostate cancer. I have found no evidence to support this view. Yes, the research has reported that a diet high in saturated animal fats will increase your risk of prostate cancer. But ackee is rich in healthy plant fats that do not increase one's risk of prostate disease. Similarly, ackee consumption does not increase one's risk of heart disease or cause an elevation in blood cholesterol.Ackee is versatileAlthough ackee is best known as part of the famous ackee and salt fish dish, it can be enjoyed in many ways. In the book Cooking with Ackee by Dean Burrowes, cooking instructor Jassie Singh shared dozens of different ways that ackee can be prepared and enjoyed. The variety of ackee dishes described is both amazing and mouth-watering. How about ackee with peas and veggie chunks or ackee and broccoli souffl\u00e9?The bottom line is - yes, ackee is a high-fat food, but those fats are healthy and not associated with disease.

She argued the strength of legislations is often undermined when accompanying laws or regulations are not passed at the same time, or in proximity to the new enactment. It is a comment The Gavel associates itself with.For far too long, and for too often, Parliament has passed bills and they are signed into law by the governor general, but, for the most part, are useless.We point, for example, at the regulations to put in place a sex offenders registry. Although the Sexual Offences Act was passed into law in 2009, and the law makes provision for a sex offenders registry, the regulations were only tabled in the Senate on Friday.In effect, despite the law being in place, the state was unable to monitor sex offenders. As a result, some of these sick individuals found themselves in schools - teaching kids or as coaches.The Gavel is of the view that some of the provisions contained in the regulations would have gone a far way in protecting communities from sexual predators. Consider, for example, the proposal that a sex offender is required to have with him at all times, a certificate of registration of sex offender, while he is away from his main residence is one that should go a far way in helping to track offenders.We believe that sex offenders must know that the stench of their crime must follow them wherever they go. Had the regulations been in place three years ago, to require that if a sex offender finds his way from his main residence without his certificate of registration of sex offender on his person, he is guilty of an offence and is liable upon summary conviction in a Resident Magistrate's Court to a fine of up to $1 million or 12 months in prison, it would have slowed the movements of serial rapists.But the Sexual Offences Act is not the only important piece of legislation for which the absence of regulations has left it toothless. There is also the Criminal Justice (Pleas Negotiations and Agreements) Act, which was passed in 2005 but for which the regulations were only passed in 2010. The bill enables the director of public prosecutions (DPP) to enter into plea-bargaining arrangements with persons who are before the courts on criminal charges. However, until two years ago, the DPP was a toothless bulldog as there were no regulations to allow for its operationalisation.Not sufficientIt is high time we get the legislative wheels turning properly. It is not sufficient to pass bills without having the regulations to give the necessary support to the bill. It is for that reason we suggest that both be drafted at the same time and be taken along the legislative wheels, like rice and peas.Naturally, this will require that the office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel be given adequate resources to do its job. It will also mean that parliamentarians be called up upon to sit more frequently to consider bills, regulations and White Papers from the Cabinet. That is the only way we are going to have the policy coherence that is necessary for our advancement as a society.thegavel@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7554, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/90d99684400aefe0", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:20.135", "title": "Senator lashes 'lazy' private sector", "occurred_at": "2012-10-08T04:18:41", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121008/lead/lead95.html", "data": "Daraine Luton, Senior Staff ReporterGovernment Senator Lambert Brown on Friday launched a broadside against elements in the private sector, saying the laziness of some sections has caused them not to be able to take advantage of business opportunities locally.\"They need to be bold, they need to see the opportunities,\" Senator Brown said.According to the senator, sections of the private sector have failed to take advantage of the trade opportunities under the Caribbean Basin Initiative with the USA and are also failing to exploit the potential of the Economic Partnership Agreement with Europe.He was contributing to the debate on the Income Tax (amendment) Act 2012.The way is now clear for multinational companies to set up their group head offices in Jamaica and see their foreign employees benefit from income tax reprieve.The Senate last Friday passed the Income Tax (amendment) Act 2012 without amendment.

Too often that happens with all the best intentions we get the best experts in the field and they write a paper without really any of it affecting the beneficiaries, which doesn't make sense,\" he told a validation workshop at the Farmers Training Centre in Twickenham Park, St Catherine.Jamaica is a beneficiary of the \u008030-million ACP Fish II Programme funded by the EU to strengthen fisheries management, improve food security and alleviate poverty in 78 ACP countries. It comes at a time when the local industry is experiencing a serious decline in aquaculture products, with last year figure of 1,149 tonnes well below the 2006 high of 8,019 tonnes.Meanwhile, Roger Clarke, minister of agriculture and fisheries, gave an assurance that the Government would ramp up its efforts to resuscitate this once-vibrant industry. He pointed to the ban on the importation of whole tilapia - fresh or frozen. While admitting that there was a breach of the waiver for tilapia fillet for the quick-service restaurants and hotel market, with some of the produce finding its way on to the open market, he noted that steps had been taken to prevent any recurrence.creating food securityThe agriculture minister insisted that the funding from international donors would be used to ensure that aquaculture plays a pivotal role in creating food security, creation of employment, import substitution and the saving foreign exchange. For its part, the Jamaican Government is committed to providing the framework to ensure that the subsector derives maximum benefits from the external assistance.\"In this financial year, some $22 million will be allocated to undertake a marketing and promotion drive, training and capacity building of fish farmers groups. Additionally, some $17 million will be allocated to rehabilitate the hatchery/nursery facility at our aquaculture branch to provide quality seed stock for the industry,\" the minister divulged.Warning of a revolution of the aquaculture subsector, he said Hill Run in St Catherine had been identified as a location for the establishment of an aquaculture agro park fitted with the requisite infrastructure to ensure sustainable production. In addition, he said the ministry would enforce more stringent measures to ensure that only wholesome fish products are imported into Jamaica.With the formalities out of the way, guests relocated to the lawns of the training centre where they were treated to tilapia prepared in a range of culinary styles by chefs from the Jamaica Culinary Federation, Longville Farms, Rainforest Foods and Dr Marc Panton, chief technical director in the agriculture ministry.rural@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7569, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b4ba5346f60f704b", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:29.404", "title": "Japex provides opportunities for St Ann farmers", "occurred_at": "2012-10-07T04:12:51", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121006/lead/lead32.html", "data": "Carl Gilchrist, Gleaner WriterNEW OPPORTUNITIES seem to be on the horizon for St Ann farmers as a result of Jamaica Product Exchange (Japex) 2012.

These included manufacturers and suppliers of services.Last year, Jampro, through its business linkages programme, facilitated the signing of contracts valued over J$100 million, with the aim of increasing that figure at Japex 2012.This year, for the first time, farmers of St Ann were represented at a Japex event, as the government agency, Rural Agricultural Development Authority (RADA) participated in the event, mounting a booth at the staging of the event, staged over three days from September 30 at Sunset Jamaica Grande Resort and Spa in Ocho Rios.\"The objective of RADA's involvement was to create an avenue for our producers and agro processors who are close to the industry,\" RADA parish manager for St Ann, Donald Robinson, told The Gleaner on Wednesday.At the event, fresh produce were on display, such as sweet pepper, hot pepper, cucumber and tomato and several processed foods. The booth attracted scores of visitors and responses were quite favourable.\"I should think the objectives were achieved. We got support and lots of commendations regarding the quality of the products we had on display,\" said Robinson. \"The outcome from all of this is that the people from the JHTA want to have a follow-up session to see how we can strengthen ties between RADA, the farmers and the hotels.\"greenhouse technologyMost of the produce on display were grown using greenhouse technology which several farmers in the parish are now employing, as it facilitates year-round production.Japex 2012 was a success all-round.

It didn't happen.One of the employees saw what was happening, took my card, purchased a ticket and returned it to me.The bus could not accept any passengers with cards on the way downtown.If the route is unprofitable - and I believe it is - cut it off.

I called the National Works Agency (NWA), and to my relief, the road was fixed a few days later.Imagine my surprise when I travelled on the same road on Monday, only to be confronted by not one, but two gaping potholes, one on each side of the road. The same pothole that was fixed last month opened up again after Sunday night's rain.Does anyone supervise these people who claim to fix our roads? It's a total waste of our tax dollars to turn around and fix a road which was fixed a month ago. What is really happening here?I am so disgusted because this has become a recurring situation.

SimonPresident, Golden Spring Citizens' AssociationAn open letter to Everton Hunter, chief executive officer the National Works Agency.We, the Golden Spring Citizens' Association, have written repeatedly on traffic congestion in Stony Hill Square, St Andrew, requesting itemised costs for the project as outlined in blueprint drawings done by the NWA's Planning Department under the leadership of Mr Stephen Shaw.We further wish to thank you for identifying with the worthy cause regarding our joint citizens' undertaking to implement this project in order to alleviate the burdensome congestion in the town square of Stony Hill, west rural St Andrew.Kindly expedite the matter so that together we may move to the next stage.Fear of gully breakaway behind Dames RoadS. Power KingstonThe erosion of the gully located behind the premises of 8 Dames Road, Kingston 5, poses an imminent threat to life and property. You can reach Dames Road after coming from Connolley Avenue, then on to Arnold Road. If you ask anyone at 8 Dames Road, they will show you. You can also locate it when coming off South Camp Road.There are a lot of houses near this gully. The water in the gully is stagnant, which facilitates the breeding of a lot of mosquitoes, a matter about which persons complain every day. The water is stagnant because the gully bed concrete is broken. Because of this, the water does not run off, and it is getting worse.When we had the rains last week, another section broke away again. This is cause for great concern as we know that the water can make the earth very soft, increasing the possibility of further breakaways of columns, and ultimately, the collapse of houses.We don't want our situation to approach the crisis proportions of erosion and danger that are currently affecting Sandy Gully or Kintyre.This gully has been in a state of disrepair for about four years now. I \nam sure the newly elected MP, Julian Robinson, is aware of it, but \nnothing has been done.Motorists have a hard time making it to Carnation WayMichael Wong Mona, St Andrew'Where is St Andrew Eastern MP Andr\u00e9 Hylton?' asks constituent and pothole victim Michael Wong.The road condition on Carnation Way has deteriorated over the years, and no patchwork has been done to reduce the cost of motor vehicle front-end repairs. With each bout of heavy rainfall, these potholes become deeper and wider.Before the recent general election, half of the Mona community was resurfaced, and we had hoped that the other half would have been resurfaced, or, at the very least, patched.But with the election having passed some nine months ago, we have not seen our member of parliament or been able to make contact with him to find out what will be done to address our problem.I suspect we will see that our road will be patched when the next election comes around.Even though all motorists pay an additional tax towards the repairs of our roads with each litre of gas purchased, these funds are being used for other purposes.When will all this sleight of hand stop and Government instead use our taxes for their intended purposes?michael.wong@cwjamaica.comTell us about the positives and negatives affecting your community, school or any other social space.

He said this number did not include those who were approved by the Students' Loan Bureau (SLB).\"We have gone to every private-sector organisation and church foundation that we can to ask them for assistance,\" the education minister noted.\"I think I can tell you that the ministries of Finance and (Education) are working to try and identify some 'spare money', if any such thing exists in other ministries \u0085 things that will not be expended but are budgeted for, to be able to assist some of those (students).\"He reasoned: \"The one thing that we must not do is that those who have done it right, those who have stayed in school, those who have passed the exams against all odds and now have tertiary ambition, we cannot possibly abandon them.\"Students should repayHowever, Thwaites warned that students who received assistance should be responsible. He stressed that those who received loans should be bonded, noting that \"people can't be allowed to go away and leave their student loans unattended\".The SLB reported this week that it was currently battling a 30 per cent delinquency rate of borrowers.On the question of the severe financial challenges now faced by the SLB, Thwaites said he had asked managing director of the National Commercial Bank, Patrick Hylton, to chair a committee which would examine private funding for the student-loan system.\"It is ironic that the State should be short of funds but the private market is, of course, flushed,\" Thwaites said.\"It is doubly ironic that you can borrow money, collateral-free, to buy season tickets to the parties at Negril, during Independence, but you have to provide a guarantor for a student loan. We don't have our priorities straight.\"Commenting further on the SLB funding crisis, Thwaites said the lending institution had said it expected to raise funds to satisfy present demand in two tranches spanning the end of the first and second school terms.The bureau is now struggling to fill a financial gap in order to make payments to tertiary institutions.The SLB has managed to source $1.7 billion of the $4.2 billion needed to finance tuition costs for students over the 2012-2013 academic year. However, the institution is having talks with financial entities in an effort to close the funding gap.Meanwhile, financial analyst Errol Gregory said the solution to the student-loan crisis would have to come from the private sector.He suggested that the commercial banks should intervene by providing concessionary loans.edmond.campbell@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7576, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/049930bcce4ee697", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:37.553", "title": "Relatives remember drowned men", "occurred_at": "2012-10-07T04:12:51", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121005/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Karen Sudu, Gleaner WriterBOG WALK, St Catherine:They have never lived apart, now Nekeisha Watt is trying to fathom how she will spend the rest of her life without her younger brother, Kemar Watt.Kemar, 25, was one of three men who drowned in the Rio Cobre Wednesday night after a trailer driven by Michael Nicholas, transporting products for Jamaica Broilers from Content Agricultural Products Limited in Bog Walk to Spring Village, careened off Flat Bridge and plunged into the river. Nicholas' son Travis was the other victim.For his sister, Kemar, a past student of Old Harbour High School, was more than a brother.\"He was my best friend. We lived loving; we were close. If I was at home and he was on the road, I could call him and say, 'Brother, get this for me',\" she reflected after she and Margaret Simpson, their mother's sister, identified Kemar's body at Robert's Funeral Home in Commodore on Thursday morning.But Watt, who told The Gleaner that their mother lived overseas and gunmen snuffed out their father's life seven years ago, said she was still unsure why her sibling, who had a passion for driving, was on the trailer.\"Last week Friday, he kept a round robin and Sunday morning he said he wasn't going to work for the rest of the week, he was gonna enjoy the money. And I don't know what happened. He went to work and later Wednesday night I got a call that he had drowned,\" a teary-eyed Watt recollected.Though she was still in shock, Simpson was able to describe her nephew, who she raised.\"Kemar was a loving person, jovial, full of jokes. He was my best nephew.

We spoke about the trailer he was working on. He was trying to finish it up so he could give it to the owner and I told him to get some rest when he was finished and he said, 'Okay',\" she said.Stewart said for her aunt Icylyn, Nicholas' wife who suffers from hypertension, the loss of her husband and son was too much to bear.\"After she heard the news, she collapsed. We took her to the hospital and the doctor made some checks and after that we took her home,\" Stewart explained.In the meantime, Jamaica Broilers Group issued a statement clarifying that the dead men were not employed to the group, as had been reported earlier in the day. Instead, they were employees of one of the group's service providers contracted to transport products.Notwithstanding, the group expressed condolences to the families of the deceased, as well as the family of the sole survivor of the accident, known as 'Belly Rat' of Spring Village in St Catherine.rural@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7577, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a3ea3b5cc4787cc6", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:38.009", "title": "Get ready to dig in!", "occurred_at": "2012-10-07T04:12:51", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121005/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Restaurant Week 2012 launched at The PegasusRestaurant Week (RW) 2012 - 'One Love, Eat Up, Live Up' - was officially launched yesterday in an idyllic garden setting at The Jamaica Pegasus hotel in New Kingston.The culinary extravaganza, organised by SSCo Event Management and The Gleaner Company, takes place from November 9-17 and promises to be the best-ever food event in Jamaica.Guest speaker Douglas Orane, non-executive chairman of GraceKennedy Ltd, lauded the organisers of RW, now in its eighth year, and embraced the celebration of food as a cultural event.\"Restaurant Week allows us to indulge in the joys of eating well.

The other ones were geared towards the regulators going in and checking,\" she said.\"The bureau is moving away from the policing and more looking at auditing these systems.\"The document, which Henry-Blair said is user-friendly, is available for sale at Technical Information System at the Bureau of Standards for $3,573.\"We're planning to have a sensitisation session for the food-processing industry.

A recent study of the SLB by PricewaterhouseCoopers made it clear that the challenge confronting the lending agency \"will require key policy decisions that can only be addressed by the GOJ (Government of Jamaica) in consultation with its various stakeholders.\"Finance Minister Dr Peter Phillips, at a recent Jamaica House briefing, indicated that the Government would be examining a number of studies in relation to the SLB in the near future.Yesterday, Monica Brown, executive director of the SLB, made a startling revelation in Gordon House when she told a parliamentary oversight committee that the bureau was struggling to make disbursements, on behalf of students, to tertiary institutions.She said for the academic period 2012-2013, the institution was facing a significant challenge to meet the $4.2 billion to be disbursed to the universities and colleges.\"So far, approximately $1.7 billion or 41 per cent of the projected $4.2 billion to be disbursed has been identified. The discussions are continuing with lending institutions in an effort to reach an agreement for the needed funds to close the funding gap,\" she told members of the Public Administration and Appropriations Committee (PAAC).The PricewaterhouseCoopers study mirrors another research done by the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), which indicated that the SLB's current loan model cannot sustain the growing demand for student loans without significant annual increases in capital.The CDB report of 2011 stated that funding from loans should not be the only option, as interest payable on borrowed funds, particularly during the moratorium period of the student loan, would result in cash-flow shortages which would have to be funded by capital injection.This situation would limit the prospect for   borrowing in the future, the report added. The SLB executive director, who commented on the findings of the PricewaterhouseCoopers study and the CDB report, said that even with a hundred per cent compliance rate, on the part of borrowers, the increased demand for more student loans calls for greater capital injection in the institution. At present, the lending agency is battling a delinquency rate of 30 per cent. \"What we really need is a clear policy direction as to where we are going with the funding of tertiary education and SLB's role,\" the bureau's executive director added. The PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants have projected a growth in demand for student loans to $34.5 billion by 2016-2017 and $87.73 billion by 2020. With this forecast, the consultants have outlined the need for an injection of funding to the tune of more than $26 billion for the five-year period ended 2016-2017 in order to close the funding gap and an overall total of $64 billion by 2020. The SLB head reported a 153 per cent increase in loan applications over a six-year period. She said between 2007 and 2012, the loan application jumped from 6,600 to 16,676. For this year alone, the SLB received 16,676 applications which represent a 23.5 per cent or 3,176 increase over the 13,500 applications received in 2011. The SLB executive director also noted that the high levels of unemployment, along with what she said was a culture of entitlement among some SLB beneficiaries, have resulted in a high rate of delinquency which has served to exacerbate the funding concerns of the SLB. She said a study has revealed that approximately 49 per cent of students who graduated in 2010 could not find a job or are underemployed. A proposal has been made for the laws to be amended to enable deductions at the source of income, which she said would help the SLB to collect from borrowers. edmond.campbell@gleanerjm.com\u00a0\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7615, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/940ed8d54042a7a2", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:49:00.964", "title": "Private sector organisation to examine agreement conditions with IMF", "occurred_at": "2012-10-03T06:20:06", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121002/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Edmond Campbell, Senior Staff ReporterTHE TOP brass of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica (PSOJ) will today sit at the table with officials from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), not to negotiate, but to discuss what the group purports to be a realistic set of conditions and timetable for an agreement with the Jamaican Government.Last week, Finance Minister Dr Peter Phillips led a team of technocrats in the start of negotiations with the IMF to arrive at a new loan agreement.Caution against overdoseCommenting on the possible conditionalities that might be attached to the agreement, Zacca said the private-sector body would caution against an overdose of \"medicine\".\"The medicine can be so strong that it kills the patient and we have to work together as team Jamaica with the IMF to figure out what the right dosage is, and that is going to be the critical thing in the next few days,\" Zacca told The Gleaner yesterday.\"We can't negotiate with them but we want to at least have them aware of our position and have us aware of their position to see if there is some sort of position we could influence in any way possible to the benefit of Jamaica.\"At the same time, Carol Narcisse, executive director of the Jamaica Civil Society Coalition (JCSC), said her group would also be holding talks today with members of the fund.\"Concern about growth has to be part of the IMF agenda.

It (the grid) is known as an essential facility and there is emerging law that allows that.\"According to Paulwell, the Government's plan is to enable real competition by allowing others to interconnect through areas such as net billing, which will allow persons who own renewable-energy generators such as wind turbines and solar systems to generate electricity for personal use while selling excess energy to the JPS.Significant developmentThe Government also intends to encourage competition in the electricity sector through wheeling.\"(That is) a significant development which is to happen soon and will allow an (electricity) generator in Manchester, who has a business there, to wheel electricity from Mandeville to his other business in Kingston ... .\"So I want us to be quite clear that what we are seeking is to use that grid, to unbundle it, and to allow people to access it to achieve greater benefits for our people.

A recent study of the SLB by PricewaterhouseCoopers made it clear that the challenge confronting the lending agency \"will require key policy decisions that can only be addressed by the GOJ (Government of Jamaica) in consultation with its various stakeholders.\"Finance Minister Dr Peter Phillips, at a recent Jamaica House briefing, indicated that the Government would be examining a number of studies in relation to the SLB in the near future.Yesterday, Monica Brown, executive director of the SLB, made a startling revelation in Gordon House when she told a parliamentary oversight committee that the bureau was struggling to make disbursements, on behalf of students, to tertiary institutions.She said for the academic period 2012-2013, the institution was facing a significant challenge to meet the $4.2 billion to be disbursed to the universities and colleges.\"So far, approximately $1.7 billion or 41 per cent of the projected $4.2 billion to be disbursed has been identified. The discussions are continuing with lending institutions in an effort to reach an agreement for the needed funds to close the funding gap,\" she told members of the Public Administration and Appropriations Committee (PAAC).The PricewaterhouseCoopers study mirrors another research done by the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), which indicated that the SLB's current loan model cannot sustain the growing demand for student loans without significant annual increases in capital.The CDB report of 2011 stated that funding from loans should not be the only option, as interest payable on borrowed funds, particularly during the moratorium period of the student loan, would result in cash-flow shortages which would have to be funded by capital injection.This situation would limit the prospect for   borrowing in the future, the report added. The SLB executive director, who commented on the findings of the PricewaterhouseCoopers study and the CDB report, said that even with a hundred per cent compliance rate, on the part of borrowers, the increased demand for more student loans calls for greater capital injection in the institution. At present, the lending agency is battling a delinquency rate of 30 per cent. \"What we really need is a clear policy direction as to where we are going with the funding of tertiary education and SLB's role,\" the bureau's executive director added. The PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants have projected a growth in demand for student loans to $34.5 billion by 2016-2017 and $87.73 billion by 2020. With this forecast, the consultants have outlined the need for an injection of funding to the tune of more than $26 billion for the five-year period ended 2016-2017 in order to close the funding gap and an overall total of $64 billion by 2020. The SLB head reported a 153 per cent increase in loan applications over a six-year period. She said between 2007 and 2012, the loan application jumped from 6,600 to 16,676. For this year alone, the SLB received 16,676 applications which represent a 23.5 per cent or 3,176 increase over the 13,500 applications received in 2011. The SLB executive director also noted that the high levels of unemployment, along with what she said was a culture of entitlement among some SLB beneficiaries, have resulted in a high rate of delinquency which has served to exacerbate the funding concerns of the SLB. She said a study has revealed that approximately 49 per cent of students who graduated in 2010 could not find a job or are underemployed. A proposal has been made for the laws to be amended to enable deductions at the source of income, which she said would help the SLB to collect from borrowers. edmond.campbell@gleanerjm.com\u00a0\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7597, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d84563d418fbd612", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:50.440", "title": "Rapist gets 40 years", "occurred_at": "2012-10-05T02:15:11", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121004/lead/lead2.html", "data": "FORMER FINANCE Minister Audley Shaw is urging the Portia Simpson Miller administration to move decisively and hand over the Trelawny stadium to the University of Technology (UTech) so that the facility can be put to productive use.Shaw yesterday admitted that the former Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) administration had erred when it refused to enter into a lease arrangement with the tertiary institution.\"I want to explicitly suggest to this government from this forum: don't make the mistake that the previous government made.

Is this really what we have to go through in carrying out our jobs?\" one teacher asked.In condemning the attack, as well as the mob killing of an Old Harbour High School teacher on the weekend, the Ministry of Education stated in a release that \"these distasteful trends have indicated that there is an urgent need to bring to the forefront at all levels of society, the issue of behaviour modification\".The ministry appealed to all citizens to regard educators as important assets, who should be honoured and respected by everyone.\"These tendencies of uncontrolled anger need to be addressed, and persons that display such maladaptive behaviour should seek whatever counselling and therapy services that are available in their communities,\" the release stated.Education Minister Ronald Thwaites also made an appeal to schools to tighten up on security and be extra vigilant.

In that case, Justice Minister Senator Mark Golding or his colleague in the lower House, Attorney General Patrick Atkinson, would be called on to provide an update.The JCSC executive director said her organisation was in the process of writing to Witter to enquire about his long-awaited report.\"It is intolerable that it has taken us this long to have even an interim report,\" Narcisse insisted.She noted that the coalition recognised that the public defender did not have some of the resources at his immediate disposal that would have improved the investigative process.Ballistics challengeNarcisse observed that the Office of the Public Defender was challenged in preparing its report due to delays in receiving the ballistics report.The coalition contended, however, that there was a lack of political will for the matter to be fully ventilated and to determine if anyone should be held accountable.\"On a bi-partisan level, I don't think there is a serious desire to have the answer.\"Human-rights lobby Jamaicans for Justice (JFJ) is also agitating for the submission of the report to Parliament.Susan Goffe, chairperson for JFJ said an issue of great concern to her organisation is the damage that was being done to the credibility of the Office of the Public Defender.\"In many of our institutions, there is an erosion of confidence and trust... and the damage that that does to the society is great.\"Therefore, I believe there is a need for some public accountability from the public defender as to what it is that is currently causing the continued delay of a response.\"Sending wrong messageGoffe argued that, \"(if) we never have accounting for an incident as massive as the Tivoli incursion was, then the signal is, in fact, sent to the security forces, both soldiers and police, that they can act in a manner where there will be no accountability\".\"Both administrations, the previous one and this one, have said they are waiting for this report but if this report never comes what happens?\" she questioned.Meanwhile, Narcisse said the country should also be informed whether the Government had requested footage collected by the United States spy plane during the incursion in May 2010.The May 2010 incursion into Tivoli Gardens was aimed at capturing then fugitive Christopher 'Dudus' Coke.In the wake of the deaths of the 73 people, Witter launched an investigation into that matter as well as the shooting death of accountant Keith Clarke at his East Kirkland Heights home in upper St Andrew.Director of Public Prosecutions' (DPP) Paula Llewellyn ruled in July that three soldiers should be charged with Clarke's murder, more than two years after his death.edmond.campbell@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7612, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4930da03b2aabd05", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:48:59.577", "title": "Clarity needed on LNG - PSOJ", "occurred_at": "2012-10-03T06:20:06", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121002/lead/lead2.html", "data": "WITH ENERGY Minister Phillip Paulwell scheduled to address the House of Representatives today, the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica (PSOJ) says it wants him to provide clarity on the way forward for the implementation of liquefied natural gas (LNG).\"We are looking for transparency and we are looking for some certainty because we feel this issue has got to be addressed in a way that the wider society buys into it and in particular, my constituency, the business sector needs to get that confidence booster out of it,\" Chris Zacca, head of the PSOJ, told participants in a Gleaner Editors' Forum at the the newspaper's central Kingston head offices yesterday.There have been jitters in the society ever since The Sunday Gleaner reported that the Government was set to announce it would not be proceeding with the implementation of LNG as planned.Last week, Paulwell told The Gleaner he was on top of issues under his portfolio and the country would get a clear idea of how the Government will be proceeding with the LNG issue when he addresses the Parliament.Paulwell yesterday briefed the Cabinet on his recent visit to South Korea and also discussed issues relating to LNG.

Sometimes a cell starts acting abnormally, breaking the conventional code of conduct, disregarding the rules, and serious diseases like cancer can develop. What is cancer?The word cancer comes from the Greek word for crab. Physicians of old noticed how in this disease, abnormal cells spread through the body in all directions seeming to crawl like a crab invading and damaging the patient's organs and tissues.Cancer is a disease of our cells and can develop from the cells in any organ or system in the body. More than 100 different types of cancer are known to modern medicine. It starts with one cell becoming abnormal. It then multiplies to produce more abnormal cells that over time invade and damage normal tissues and organs. Only then do symptoms manifest themselves, and this may take many years to happen. For example, by the time the lump from breast cancer is large enough to be felt, it would have been quietly developing over 10 or more years.Medical tests like mammograms would only have discovered the lump one to two years earlier, and by that time, the cancer is no longer confined to the breast. Instead of just looking out for the symptoms of cancer, we are better served if we address the causes of cancer. The ultimate solution to any problem is to determine the underlying causes and correct them.What causes cancer?Cancer cells act crazy! For one thing, unlike normal cells, they multiply indefinitely, acting as if they are immortal and cannot die. But their behaviour is suicidal as they end up killing themselves by destroying the very body they inhabit.Why? The behaviour of a cell is governed by the genetic material (DNA) that resides in the nucleus of that cell. Damaged DNA sends out abnormal instructions to the cells causing them to act insanely and cancer results. Here are some of the common causes of cancer that science has identified.Poor nutrition: What you eat has everything to do with your cancer risk. My article last week highlighted how vitamins, minerals, and herbs called antioxidants protect the cells from damage. A diet high in fresh fruit, vegetables (antioxidant rich), and fibre lowers your cancer risk while eating foods high in animal fats and low in fibre will increase your chances of getting cancer. This applies to many common cancers including colon, breast, prostate, and lung cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends that for cancer protection we eat over seven servings of fruit and vegetables daily. In addition, regular use of the antioxidant supplements I listed last week will enhance cancer protection.Immune incompetence: Although abnormal cancerous cells form in our body regularly, we also have our own anti-cancer security system called the immune system, which detects and destroys these abnormal cells. When cancer cells are allowed to proliferate, this indicates that the immune system is malfunctioning. There are many natural ways to enhance immune function. This is critical for our health in general as well as cancer protection in particular.Infection and inflammation: The experts have clearly identified chronic inflammation and infections, particularly viral infections, as definite causes of cancer. Common examples are the associations between the Human Papilloma Virus and cervical cancer and the hepatitis virus, a liver cancer. Inflammation in the stomach and colon can set the stage for cancers there while chronic gum and tooth infections may also heighten your cancer risk.Hormones: Hormones are powerful chemical messengers that influence the behaviour of all cells, especially the cells of our reproductive organs. Hormonal imbalance is a major factor in causing cancers of the breast, prostate, uterus, and testicles. This is related not only to changes in lifecycles and lifestyles, but also to thousands of chemicals in the modern environment that have hormonal activity. The hormone oestrogen and chemicals called xenoestrogens are major culprits.Chemical pollution and radiation: In addition to the hormonal disrupters mentioned above, there are many other sources of chemical and electromagnetic pollution in our homes and work places. These invisible, subtle, ever-present agents of cancer play multiple roles in the creation of malignancy. Everyday objects like cellphones, plastic bottles, or TV and computer screens may all add to a toxic burden that compromises our capacity to avoid cancer.Heredity: Our scientists have unravelled the human genetic code, and they are now working hard to identify genes that we can blame for cancer. This will allow for the development of new and expensive gene therapies. However, it is estimated that less than 20 per cent of our illnesses can be blamed on genes, and over 80 per cent are related to environment and lifestyle.The fact that you are born with a gene, say, for breast cancer, does not mean that you will get breast cancer. It indicates that your risk is increased and that you should be particularly vigilant about your lifestyle practices. Genes exist and can be switched on (activated) or remain silent (inactive) by the factors mentioned above. You are not a helpless victim of even your genes.Mental attitude and stress: As human beings, we are not just a body, but an integration of body, mind, and spirit. Just using those three different words encourages a division in our thinking that interferes with a truly holistic approach. I have coined a term \"menscorp\" to try to avoid this split.Dealing with the body-mind, the menscorp is critical in addressing the cancer issue.The research shows that one's mental state has a profound effect on delicate matters like immune function and hormonal balance, all of which influence cancer risk. Chronic anxiety, depression, negative thinking, emotional trauma can all tip the scale and initiate cancer. On the other hand, optimism, joy, faith, prayer, and gratitude reap powerful benefits for health and wellness. Your mental and spiritual attitudes are important instruments in your anti-cancer toolbox.

He was addressing JPs at their third quarterly meeting at Fellowship Tabernacle, off the Washington Boulevard on Saturday.Speaking against the background of recent police excesses that have earned them the wrath of civil society, Bishop Welsh spelled out his request for H.E.L.P from the JPs as follows: Hold up the oath of office to officers whenever you see them and ensure that they know it and are obeying it. He said a recent interview of 100 members of the force showed that whereas they were supposed to take the oath of office after \"passing out\" and every five years thereafter, 90 of them had only taken it once. Encourage policemen to do right and refrain from doing wrong, give them good advice. Bishop Welsh said if JPs observed that a rookie cop who is taking home $80,000 a month is driving a new luxury car that was valued way above his pay grade, it was the JP's duty to speak to the cop's superiors. Legislate by making demands about what happens in your communities; these include bringing back foot patrols throughout the community. Pray for the officers daily; visit the stations as often as possible, they will welcome your prayers. In a very engaging yet thought-provoking presentation, Welsh shared some sobering facts with his audience. He asked them to view the life of a policeman as they had never done before. He said cops were not going out to deliberately shoot people but many of them have a split second to make a decision whether to take a life, whereas most people had days, weeks, and even months to mull over similar circumstances.AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY\"I joined the force at age 171/2 and by age 19, I was a full-fledged policeman. I was given an awesome responsibility; after a mere six months, I had the authority to lock you up,\" said Welsh to his eager listeners. He said that in the six months of training, officers had to be competent at more than 60 areas of the work, sit five exams and go on to further training on the job.He noted that with 10,000 men and women in the force, there were up to 12,500 (some repeat) requests for counselling so far, 70 per cent of which were for personal and relationship matters. Many cops were requesting sick leave not because they were ill but because they were suffering from stress. And, of the more than 300 police stations or posts, some 150 have no spiritual support. The eight chaplains are insufficient to reach them all.Meanwhile, Custos of St Andrew Marigold Harding encouraged JPs to report for jury duty as a way of helping to decrease the 580 cases that are to be disposed of during the Michaelmas term of the Home Circuit Court. Of that number, 340 are murder cases but often they have to be traversed because of a lack of jurors. If you are called to do duty, please do not send in sick leave. It starts with you, so act responsibly.\"barbara.ellington@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7627, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/762ba3ba2aef22a2", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:49:07.370", "title": "Lies about the Pill", "occurred_at": "2012-10-02T01:14:06", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121001/lead/lead94.html", "data": "Keisha Hill, Gleaner WriterTHERE ARE some common misconceptions or beliefs about the use of contraceptions, but, according to Dr Philip Smits, senior vice-president for Global Strategic Marketing for Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, who has worked extensively with various organisations, many of these are myths.Some of these misconceptions state that women should take a break from the Pill; the most risky moment for losing the Pill is at the middle of the treatment; the Pill produces cancer and the regular use of the morning-after Pill is a good contraceptive method.\"There has been a comprehensive study of the Pill and the facts show that these myths are not true. The Pill is safe when it is used as directed with proper consultation. It is a drug, and (as is the case with) most drugs, it has benefits and also favourable risks,\" Smits said.\"The most important element of our educational drive is to provide women with options. We advise them to take precautionary methods, but accidents do happen, and this is where the emergency contraceptive is good. It should not be used as contraception on demand. The amount of hormones in one package is high, it has to be high to be effective and hence must not be used regularly,\" Smits added.Another method of contraceptive should be used on a regular cycle, according to Smits, and the emergency contraceptive should only be used as the name suggests in a truly emergency situation. He said the effectiveness of the emergency contraceptive is also dependent on where the woman is in her cycle.Other myths about contraceptives include statements that the Pill is not safe and it produces birth defects, and long-term use of the Pill can affect fertility. However, Smits said the Pill is most risky when a woman starts a strip and forgets at least one pill per cycle.\"The Pill becomes less reliable and if they forget multiple pills then it further diminishes the desired results. Timing is also important, taking the Pill can be built into a routine although it doesn't have to be taken at the same hour everyday. Most women take it at bedtime, and as we are in the digital age they set timers to remind themselves,\" Smits said.Smits also indicated that it is better to forget taking a pill in the middle of the cycle than at the beginning. He said in the United States, the failure rate is between five and eight per cent because women forget to take the Pill, had bouts of diarrhoea or were on other medications that interfered with the dosage of the Pill.\"The Pill has been on the market for 50 years. The modern pills contain only a fraction of the Pills from the early 60s. We have managed to make available the lowest possible dose of hormones with the best cycle control,\" Smits said.keisha.hill@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7628, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/60a95859995ee79c", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:49:07.815", "title": "'Don't come to us!'", "occurred_at": "2012-10-02T01:14:06", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121001/lead/lead1.html", "data": "Janet Silvera, Senior Gleaner WriterFemale attorneys shying away from MoBay rape caseWESTERN BUREAU:THE TWO men being held in the brutal rape of five females, including an eight-year-old girl, are to face an identification parade early this week.The men, who, reportedly, are brothers, have been in custody since last Thursday.

A GI is a name, or sign, used on certain products, which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin. The use of a GI may act as certification that the product possesses certain qualities and is made according to traditional methods, or boasts a certain reputation, due to its geographical origin.\"We have had some support from the government of the Netherlands and we are now registering jerk, coffee, and our rum,\" Donovan Stanberry, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, said during a Gleaner Editors' Forum held at the company's North Street offices last Thursday.He added: \"We have to do it in as many countries as possible. It's hard to enforce, but we just have to make an example out of a few people, and then the rest will learn, but we are on the right track,\" he stated.Within the Jamaican context, this designation will protect the integrity of Jamaican rums, coffee, and jerk products in an effort to discourage piracy and product counterfeiting, and in general, enhance the competitiveness of the product.Restaurateur Jacqui Tyson recounted an experience abroad where she noticed products were labelled brand Jamaica, but were not authentically Jamaican. \"What we need to do is to own our brand. Every fancy restaurant across the world has jerk on the menu, but what the ministry needs to do is to point out what is authentic jerk,\" she said.Measures put in placeAccording to Joan Webley, manager of copyrights and related rights at JIPO, there are measures that are being put in place to protect brand Jamaica.\"Although brand Jamaica isn't covered by JIPO, we offer trademark registration services. We now offer local registration, and when Jamaica becomes a signatory to the Madrid Protocol, then we can protect our brand in different countries around the world. Right now, it can be done for Jamaica and not internationally, but we are hoping that by year end, it will be signed,\" Webley said.She added: \"Another way that JIPO is trying to protect brand Jamaica is through the geographical indication registration, which gives protection to food and products that are derived from Jamaica.\"She used France and Mexico as examples as to what the GI would achieve. \"France was able to get that geographical indication on champagne so that the only thing that can be called champagne has to come from France. They also did the same with cognac, and Mexico the same with tequila,\" she stated.Webley said the process of getting the GI is not very easy.\"We have started working with the Jamaica Jerk Association and the coffee manufacturers, as well as with the Jamaica Rums and Spirits, but we have reached the furthest with the Jamaica Jerk Association.\"\"It is the association that needs to decide on what needs to be adhered to for the product to be deemed acceptable.

Brown is originally from Kingston.Hall said the diaspora group would be willing to work with Woman Inc, organisers of the recent Black Friday protest.\"I think Woman Inc needs resources, and while we want to help the family of five now, we recognise that this is a broad-spectrum problem plaguing the country.\"She said the country has reached a turning point where persons can no longer bury their heads in the sand and pretend that these heinous crimes against babies are not happening.\"It is a stain on our country's honour,\" was her parting shot.janet.silvera@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7636, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5562493f16d86e42", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:49:20.966", "title": "Hang them - Jamaicans call for death penalty, castration for rapists", "occurred_at": "2012-09-30T04:19:18", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120930/lead/lead1.html", "data": "Tyrone Reid, Senior Staff ReporterOutraged by the recent spate of rapes, including the violation of an eight-year-old girl at gunpoint while her mother was held captive in nearby bushes, several prominent Jamaicans have joined a groundswell calling for stiffer penalties for sexual predators.Late last week, the police announced that they were questioning two brothers in a bid to find the perpetrators of the rape of five females that took place in Irwin Point, St James. But, that has done little to console the Jamaicans who are baying for the blood of the attackers.Dorcy Williams, grandmother of Ananda Dean - the 11-year-old girl in whose honour the national abduction alert mechanism known as Ananda Alert was named after she was raped and murdered in September 2008, called on the Jamaican Government to up the ante on punishment meted out to convicted sexual offenders.\"The gallows in Spanish Town are getting very rusty and they need to be used, and it is time we start using them on these rapists. The raping of children is just as bad as committing a murder ... we need to start hanging these rapists,\" said Williams, the paternal grandmother of Ananda.Williams' call for the death penalty for rapists came during a march in the Corporate Area last Friday condemning violence and sexual crimes against the nation's women and children.Under Jamaican law, only persons convicted of capital murder can face the death penalty, which is still on the books but has not been actioned in years.Renato Adams, retired senior superintendent of police, said laws should be passed allowing for the castration of persons found guilty of raping a minor.\"Those who rape girls under the age of consent should be castrated and given a sentence of 30 years at hard labour. If they rape and kill the victim, the gallows is a must,\" said Adams.The controversial crime fighter, who is now the managing director of Adams Security Management Unit, said his suggestion was not an emotional or knee-jerk response.\"Our women and \nchildren, including our boys, have been suffering at the hands of these \nbeasts and cannibals, and nothing effective is being done to stop them,\"\n contended Adams.He added: \"These are innocent people\n who can't defend themselves, and their dignity has been taken away \ncompletely.\"The retired crime fighter also told \nThe Sunday Gleaner that his sojourn to other parts of\n the world revealed to him that Jamaica needs stiffer punitive measures \nto deter predators from raping women and children.\"I \nwent to Africa in 1989 and in a part of that country and its environs if\n you stole anything, they would cut off your hand, but when I reached \nand went around I didn't notice a lot of one-handed persons. I was \nsurprised,\" Adams recalled.The former tough-talking \ncop said a policeman and an attorney in the African nation he visited \nexplained to him that not many one-handed persons are seen walking \naround because the weight of the punishment for stealing was sufficient \nto act as a deterrent.Swift action in \ncourtAdams also called for the swift trying of rape \ncases because persons charged for rape and released on bail often \ncontinue to commit their heinous crimes while on the \nroad.This, the ex-cop said he knew from personal \nexperience. \"They shouldn't be given bail until the charge is dealt \nwith, so cases of this nature should be cleared in a year,\" argued \nAdams.Meanwhile, Percival LaTouche, president of the \nAssociation for the Resettlement of Returning Residents, who has offered\n in the past to be the country's hangman, joined the chorus calling for \nthe death penalty for rapists.\"Once you catch them, \ntry them fast ... then they should be taken into the square of the area \nwhere they committed the crime, and hang them up high. Hang them without\n any mercy,\" said LaTouche.He added: \"If they want a \nhangman, give me a flask of white rum and I will drop them one by one. I\n don't want any pay for it. I wouldn't even blink an \neye.\"Same punishment LaTouche \nshared the view that there is no difference between raping a woman or \nchild and committing a murder and said both crimes should attract the \nsame punishment - death.He argued that Jamaica's \nlawmakers need to get their act together and stop passing laws without \nthe political will to enforce them.\"If you pass laws \nuntil God comes and you don't enforce them, it is a waste of time so you\n can just forget it,\" said LaTouche.Betty-Anne \nBlaine, convenor of the group Hear the Children's Cry, told The\n Sunday Gleaner that life without the possibility of parole \nshould be the minimum punishment handed to rapists.\"I\n think that some of these sexual crimes deserve the strongest punishment\n that any society can give and that is the death penalty.

These are some of the situations that my teachers and guidance counsellors have to deal with,\" added McDonald.He said the school is then left on its own to deal with the problems, many of which are caused by the socio-economic conditions these children live in.With many of the students coming from some of the volatile and depressed communities in east Portland including Prospect, Breast Work, Hall's Avenue, Janga Gully, and Chilly Lane, McDonald and her team have introduced special counselling sessions to reduce the indiscipline and level of hostility displayed by some.According to McDonald, in some instances, when parents are made aware of the problems and misbehaviour by their children, the response is frightening.\"Them lucky more than me,\" is one response McDonald said the administrators at the school have heard from parents whose children are at risk.Negligence &amp; irresponsibilityWith a student population of more than 1,000 and with only two guidance counsellors, one for each shift, and with social unrest among some students increasing, McDonald is convinced that the negligence and irresponsibility on the part of some parents and guardians are the main factors leading to the misbehaviour of some students.McDonald argued that unless the social background of some students is assessed and investigated, many will pass through the system as failures.\"We have engaged them in frequent and rigorous guidance counselling. Along with that, students who continue to display high levels of anti-social behaviour are sent to a child psychologist in the parish.\"Other students are referred to, and receive sessions, from the Child Development Agency representative, along with the community safety and security personnel of the Jamaica Constabulary Force in Port Antonio.\"There has been improvement on the part of some students, but unless the Ministry of Education takes a closer look at the socio-economic background of students, then the problem of attitude, indiscipline, and violence will continue in schools,\" said McDonald.\"However, we are committed to teach and to ensure that student are properly groomed and are given every opportunity to learn,\" added McDonald, as she expressed pride in the performance of her teachers.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7647, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/15c0b624786edd77", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:49:25.997", "title": "Mob kills school teacher", "occurred_at": "2012-09-30T04:19:18", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120930/lead/lead9.html", "data": "Rasbert Turner, Sunday Gleaner WriterWhat started as a hit-and-run traffic accident on the Old Harbour Road in St Catherine last Friday ended with two men dead.Reports from the police are that about 7:20 p.m., an unidentified man was walking along Old Harbour Road when he was hit by a motor vehicle which did not stop.Residents came to the injured man's assistance and in the process blocked sections of the roadway.It is further reported that 41-year-old school teacher Michael Melbourne was driving a Toyota Hiace motor vehicle when he encountered the crowd.Melbourne reportedly started tooting his horn and attempted to go through the crowd allegedly hitting several persons in the process.Stabbed repeatedly He was then dragged from the vehicle and stabbed repeatedly by residents.The injured persons were taken to hospital by residents, where Melbourne and the unidentified man were pronounced dead.As the news of Melbourne's death spread, colleagues expressed shock and sadness.\"It is a sad thing.

Patterson and Edward Seaga in Gordon House, in 2005, Munroe argued that most \"extreme forms of non-compliance\" reflected in the use of armed violence had diminished.However, he contended that the retention of the political ombudsman, whose statutorily grounded function required the policing of the code, was critical, as an honest review of it would reveal continued breaches and non-compliance.According to Munroe, the country still has a far way to go, before \"the parties eschew the practice of political tribalism\" as required by the Political Code of Conduct.He also cited another section of the agreement where, he said, the political parties are not even close to achieving compliance.Munroe quoted from a section of the code which stated: \"Officials who by virtue of their positions have control or influence over the appropriation of public funds or other public resources, should not discriminate against any individual, group or community on the basis of political allegiance or support.\"The motion, which is being examined by the Human Resources and Social Development Committee, had also indicated that the original mandate of the political ombudsman was met, but the NIA executive director reasoned that the work of the office transcended elections and election campaigns.Munroe suggested that complaints or allegations of violations would \"clearly continue to require investigation\" and, therefore, the body charged by law to carry out that task was the Office of the Political Ombudsman.During the committee deliberations members questioned whether the country was receiving value for money in a case where $18.62 million was being spent each year, yet the political ombudsman only becomes very active during an election period which could be called, in the case of Local Government, every three years, while for national elections, a maximum of five years.But Munroe told the Parliamentary Committee that Patterson and Seaga, to their credit, had committed in 2005 to go beyond the terms of the Joint Agreement and Declaration on Political Conduct.He said the leaders had pledged to work together on additional measures such as the vexed issue of the distribution of scare benefits.By 2011, the Bruce Golding-led Jamaica Labour Party had advanced two additional measures. They are the strengthening of the Political Code of Conduct and to establish the Office of the Political Ombudsman in the Constitution of Jamaica.Political Ombudsman Bishop Herro Blair submitted in his annual report of 2008 specific recommendations designed to replace the ineffective 'bark' of his office with effective teeth to bite.He wants the Political Code of Conduct to be extended beyond a gentleman's agreement to one in which sanctions are applicable to those found in breach of it.Fine on candidates Among the changes proposed by the political ombudsman are the imposition of a fine on candidates and the party they represent for breaches of the code; refer offenders of the code to the director of public prosecutions and recommend to Parliament the removal of parliamentarians he has fou,nd to be unfit for office.For these recommendations to become a reality, Section 22 of the Act which established the political ombudsman would have to be amended in order to specify breaches of the code as offences and to attach to such offences appropriate severe penalties.Munroe said the previous administration, in its monthly update to the Council of the Partnership for Transformation, had reported on a Cabinet submission seeking approval to issue drafting instructions to legislate offences and penalties for breaches to the Code of Political Conduct.\"This document merits full reproduction as it proposes measures going in the very opposite direction from that proposed by the resolution before the Sessional Select Committee\" the NIA executive director asserted.\"There appears to have been consensus between the two parliamentary parties, the private sector and civil society that the Office of the Political Ombudsman not only was not redundant, not only continued to be relevant, but needed to be strengthened,\" argued Munroe.Expand the marchIn the meantime, during a brief presentation to the committee, Chairperson for the Jamaica Civil Society Coalition, Carol Narcisse, invited the committee and by extension, the Government to expand the march towards a model political electoral system in the world.Narcisse noted that as a teenager she never thought she would live to see a Jamaica where ballot stealing was not the norm, \"in which violence, resulting in the freshest memory that I had was 800 Jamaicans dying and that we thought was the worst thing that could happen, and then we live to see even more occurring every year.\"\"We fashioned for ourselves as a people a transformative vision and then having created that vision we worked to establish the institution, and we gave that institution our commitment of time and money, and together we created an electoral process that other people around the world come to study and to ask our directors of election to come to their countries and support them.\"She challenged members of the committee to say whether they agree with the larger goal and vision of continuing the process of transforming Jamaica's political culture or not.\"If we agree that that is the purpose, then we would agree that $18 million a year is worth the price in order to get to the destination that we are trying to get to,\" she said, in relation to the annual sum allocated to the Office of the Political Ombudsman.\"If, in my lifetime, we have come as far as we have, then in your children's lifetime they can see a possibility of us ending it,\" she opined.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7638, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0977ad114a46d778", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:49:21.871", "title": "South Camp Road it is - Security officials finally confirm reports that female prisoners are to be moved", "occurred_at": "2012-09-30T04:19:18", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120930/lead/lead11.html", "data": "The Government is now trying to find the money to retrofit the South Camp Road Rehabilitation Centre which is slated to be the new home of Jamaica's female prisoners.Weeks after a Sunday Gleaner exclusive report that the Department of Correctional Services (DCS) has been given until December to move the women that were being held at the Fort Augusta Adult Correction Centre, the confirmation came last week.The DCS and its parent agency - the Ministry of National Security - announced that the South Camp Road Rehabilitation Centre, in Kingston, is to be renovated at a cost of $65 million.Far from ready The South Camp Road facility previously housed male inmates, but is being remodelled to accommodate the inmates from Fort Augusta.However, the facility is far from ready.

She spent most of her working years at the Spalding, Clarendon, facilityHarriott is from Colleyville, Manchester, where she attended the Bryce Primary School, then went to Knox College.With the desire to be a nurse, she enrolled in the Kingston School of Nursing and graduated as a registered nurse (RN) in 1975.\"From I was a little girl, I just loved nursing. My grandmother was very ill. She had asthma so I have been always looking after her even when she had asthma attacks. I wanted to be a nurse from then,\" she related.After graduating from nursing school, Harriott worked at the Bellevue Hospital in Kingston for five years. She started working at the Percy Junor Hospital on October 1, 1980, and remained there until going on pre-retirement leave.During that time, she returned to the Kingston School of Nursing to be trained as a midwife, and was also trained as a sister in 2001. She has worked in that capacity at Percy Junor since then.In describing her time spent in the nursing profession, Harriott said: \"It has been good over the years. It's something that you get a lot of self-satisfaction from. You feel satisfied at the end of the day that you have done something great, that you have served humanity, you helped somebody out.\"She added, \"In nursing, you are not just dealing with sickness, you have to deal with the spiritual part of the person, as well as the social part and emotional part. It's a holistic thing in helping in whatever way that you can. Those things help in the patient recuperating better and quicker.\"Looking at the early days at Percy Junor as a nurse, Harriott said it was much harder compared to now. She explained, \"In those days, you had two wards to be in charge of, both medical and surgical, and you had just one registered nurse and one enrolled nurse.\"There was a sister in charge and when she is not on duty, it's just the RN. Sometimes you had a ward assistant. You never had much in those days, so you were very tired at the end of the day.\"Harriott said that with more nurses and doctors working now, as well as the improved facilities at Percy Junor and at other hospitals, the job is much easier for nurses.She recounted one of her most memorable moments as a nurse. \"It was the first delivery I did on my own in 1999.

Almost 17 years ago, he met in a motorcycle crash in which his neck was dislocated and his spine injured, leaving him paralysed. He did not allow his disability to hold him back, however. He decided instead to serve his community.\"When I came back to St Mary after spending time at the Mona Rehab, I got myself involved in a youth club, and because of my involvement in the club, I became the president. Then I became president of the Richmond Area Council. Then I became president of the St Mary Youth Club Council and I was sent to do training in family-life counselling. I became a peer counsellor,\" Maragh told The Gleaner.WORK FOR SUCCESSMaragh added: \"During my meetings with young people, I helped to assure them that they could strive towards any goal they want, and if they work hard enough, they can make it.\"Maragh believes that volunteerism gives people the opportunity to honestly make a contribution to individual upliftment, as well as civic pride.\"I was able to reorient myself, get back into the mainstream of society, volunteer my service, because the need was there to help people and to show people that you might be down, but not out. Once you develop the character, the strength, and the courage, you can be an effective force for change in Jamaica,\" he said.Maragh said he promises to be fair and to keep to the moral ideals of a JP.\"One of the main things is to continue to allow justice to prevail in St Mary. There are a lot of injustices in the parish and I promise and I pledge to be faithful, honest, and impartial in discharging my duties as a justice of the peace,\" he told The Gleaner.Maragh continued: \"Jamaica looks bright with so many persons volunteering their service to help this country.\"He encouraged people to volunteer their services to make Jamaica the ideal place in which to live.\"We need persons who are honest, true, dedicated to building Jamaica.

Tyson said the institutions were not seeing the graduates \"on site\", thus facilitating opportunities for feedback on performance.\"There's not a strong enough linkage there, so you have a flood of people and I have found that I now have to have a quality assurance officer inside, where the only thing she concentrates on is internal training and service,\" she said.Tyson felt the food industry was one of the fastest-growing employment sectors.\"People must eat,\" she said, noting that recently she placed an ad for 10 employees and got more than 500 applicants.More work experience  neededEverton Baker, chief public health inspector for Kingston and St Andrew, noted the department issues 25,000 food handler's permits per annum, perhaps an indication of the industry's popularity.

So it's no longer enough just to be a 'good cook'. And if you can't read and write, you can't understand all the food and health restrictions and they are very important because the worse thing for you is to have a client who says they ate and got sick,\" said Tyson.She also pointed out that people within the industry don't give workers their \"professional status\".\"There are various positions within the industry.

Sheree-Ann Whatley We need to set up surveillance cameras in communities so that you can see what is happening. We also need to improve on community watch where certain systems are set up that people can pick up if anything wrong is happening. The Government also needs to put in harsher penalties for persons who commit crimes against women.Darcy SalmonWe have to protect the females from young to old. We all have to try and stand up for all women and to protect them. For instance, if you see a strange young girl on the streets certain time, we have to question her, find out if she is missing from somewhere. We need stricter penalties for persons who rape or abuse women.Stephanie Burrell After all the marching, it comes down to one thing, we have to get rid of those monsters who would rape an eight-year-old. They don't even deserve to go to jail, we should just put laws in place to have them, killed instantly because if we don't get rid of them, it is going to happen again very soon. Natasha Singh I believe we need to pursue serious legislative changes and come up with laws that will ensure that those who practise violence against our women and children be adequately punished.

They need to understand their body and that if something doesn't feel right, it is quite likely not right,\" she argued.According to Dr Ganesh Shetty, consultant child psychiatrist, some adults have failed the children both directly and indirectly.\"We put up with so much stuff, we keep quiet because it is not our business and we think it is far away, not in our household, so it is OK as it doesn't affect us. But the more we think that it doesn't affect us is the more these things are going to happen,\" Shetty said.Among the things he said could have caused persons to carry out these activities are psychosocial factors, their sexualisation and mental disorder.\"How they have been raised, if they are raised making them feel selfish, all they have to do is use other people to fulfil their needs.

This show of support will allow members of the public to express their outrage and condemnation of the continued attacks on mothers, sisters, daughters, nieces, nephews and brothers.PROTEST ACTION\"The Government and Opposition encourage all well-thinking and progressive members of the public to join women's organisations and wear black on Friday and, at 10 a.m., stand at public places across Jamaica, including Half-Way Tree Clock Tower, in this protest action,\" stated a joint release issued by the OPM.The organisations urged persons unable to attend to still participate in the protest by observing two minutes of silence at 10 a.m. in their workplaces and in their homes.Falconer has directed the Bureau of Women's Affairs to deliver a summary of recommendations from groups that work to promote gender harmony, and that also support women, for deliberation at a meeting to be held on October 11 at Jamaica House.Angry, disturbed and distressed by the rape, executive director of the Bureau of Women's Affairs, Faith Webster, said: \"We have to find a way to take back our country, and the mothers will have to start turning in their sons.\"Condemning the atrocity, Webster said women and children at times are no longer safe to carry out their regular activities as they are subject to violence on a daily basis.She said: \"This violence takes many forms: physical, emotional, sexual and psychological.\"Another vocal advocate, Joyce Hewett, head of the public education and legal reform programme at Woman Inc, who was also in attendance at the meeting, said any long-term activity must have the ability to make an impact in changing the behaviour of the men who think it ok to go out and rape indiscriminately.BREAK THE SILENCELike many in the country, Hewett said she was convinced that the time has come to inculcate a change of values in people who remain silent.\"The mothers, the fathers, the entire family, they are usually aware that the young girls and boys are being abused; they need to start speaking,\" she said.The Woman Inc public education officer said Jamaicans needed to come out of that mindset and start thinking in terms of protecting the island's children.\"As a show of unity, we are asking everybody to just stand up and be counted in terms of sexual violence, show what our position must be, which is zero tolerance,\" she stated.She is convinced that the new combined effort of the private sector, NGOs and Government would work this time around, as the pressure will remain.\"We have a unified approach.\"Others persons and organisations in attendance were Opposition Spokesperson on Women and Gender Affairs Olivia 'Babsy' Grange; the Centre for the Investigation of Sexual Offences and Child Abuse, Women's Research and Outreach Centre, Sistren Theatre Collective, Office of the Children's Registry, the Press Association of Jamaica, the Catholic Schools Ministry, the Jamaica Household Workers Association, Women's Media Watch, Jamaicans for Justice, UWI Institute of Gender and Development Studies, the Child Development Agency, Young Women's Leadership Initiative, the People's National Party Women's Movement, the People's National Party Youth Organisation, the National Organisation of Women of the Jamaica Labour Party and the 51% Coalition.janet.silvera@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7671, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bdac7dd829a9bda8", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:49:41.447", "title": "Fire leaves more than 60 homeless", "occurred_at": "2012-09-29T03:55:46", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120927/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Gary Spaulding, Senior Gleaner WriterMore than 60 people were yesterday left homeless as a massive fire wiped out an entire block comprising several residential dwellings and a few business establishments that transect Regent and Beeston streets and Chestnut Lane near the heavily commercialised area of western Kingston.The tragedy is the latest in a series of infernos that have haunted the poverty-ravaged community over the past month and easily the most devastating to date.Karen Foote was hit with a double whammy, having been burnt out of her nearby Chestnut Lane home recently, and gone to live with her mother, Majorie Rodney.\"Only two weeks ago inna Chestnut Lane and de same thing happen. The whole a mi baby dem tings burn out,\" Foote lamented.HEART-RENDINGThe spectacle was heart-rending as a throng of wailing women, most with young babies resting on their arms, wept openly in the already deprived community.An entire family was left homeless.

When pressed, for an explanation, heated young mothers noisily complained they were being asked to pay what they could not afford for electricity since the system was regularised.Another group of fuming men directed their anger at members of a team of firefighters after it was discovered that the trucks were without water and they had to summon assistance.McKenzie shared the men's sentiments.\"It is a sad reflection on the country because this is the seventh fire in my constituency in less than a month.

The slight difference this time around is that Alecia is not the victim; she is one of the many persons who are horrified by Monday night's brutal rape of five females, including an eight-year-old child, by two gunmen just a mile away from where she had her brutish experience.On a quiet Friday evening five years ago, Alecia walked through the gate of her yard. The twilight was just about giving way to the darkness. All she wanted to do was grab a quick shower, watch some television and relax.Her thoughts were abruptly broken by a commanding voice from her darkened backyard.\"Hey gal! Don't move.\"She froze in her tracks as three men, all armed with handguns, walked towards her.\"I was forcefully dragged away from my yard and was gun-butted several times in my face as I tried to resist,\" recalled Alecia, who has asked that her real name not be used. \"They made it clear that they were going to rape me and that if I did not cooperate, I would be killed.\"LOST WILL TO FIGHTStunned by the battering she took from being gun-butted, Alecia steadily lost her will to fight. The men stopped dragging her when they reached a heavily wooded area some 200 metres from her home.\"They took turns raping me, cutting short my protest with punches,\" said Alecia. \"I passed out several times as they had their way with me \u0085 . It was by far the worst experience of my life.\"When the assault ended, Alecia recalled listening in fear as the men discussed how they should kill her and where they would dispose of her body.\"I started to cry and beg \u0085 . I told them I was a single mother and killing me would destroy the lives of my children,\" said Alecia. \"Thankfully, after a long discussion between them, one of them decided that I should not be killed.\"Without any further argument, the men walked away, leaving Alecia on the flat rock, where they had brutally violated her.\"I managed to drag myself up and walk home \u0085 . I was covered with a mixture of blood and dirt and I was hurting all over,\" said Alecia. \"When I got home and looked into the mirror, I was a total wreck \u0085 . Both eyes were swollen and my face was distorted.\"HEALINGOver the past five years, Alecia has healed both mentally and physically. Instead of allowing the initial trauma of the brutal experience to haunt her future, she threw herself headlong into caring for her children.\"It is something I wish had not happened, but thankfully, I have managed to put it all behind me,\" she said. \"When I hear about incidents of rape, such as on Monday night, my own experience sometimes comes back to me, but I never allow those thoughts to linger \u0085 . I have left that chapter of my life behind me.\"Quizzed as to what advice she would give to Monday night's victims, Alecia was quite philosophical, saying they just have to dig deep within and find the strength and courage to go on.\"They just need to realise that what happened to them was not their fault, so they should not blame themselves,\" she said. \"They should seek good medical attention, follow up with good counseling and then allow their bodies, soul and mind to heal over time.\"Monday night's victims, who are reportedly all members of one family, ranged in ages from eight to 28. Like Alecia, they were taken outside of their yard and repeatedly raped by their two attackers. The eight-year-old was admitted to hospital after her ordeal.The incident has attracted wholesale condemnation from the Government, the Opposition, the Church and many other prominent local organisations.adrian.frater@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7673, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/586b18328581a3b7", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:49:43.067", "title": "Give love and support to those suffering trauma, abuse", "occurred_at": "2012-09-27T02:07:12", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120927/lead/lead4.html", "data": "Anastasia Cunningham, News CoordinatorThe best way for a community to help victims of rape and abuse is to provide love and support, counselling psychiatrist Joyce Chambers has advised.\"Rape and abuse is a very traumatic experience and the victims need to feel that they are not alone and that they were not responsible for the attack or the abuse,\" Chambers told The Gleaner yesterday.\"It is imperative that people around them provide as much love, care and support as possible.\"However, she noted, anything beyond that could create more harm than good.\"Sometimes persons without the training and requisite skill try to help and make the situation and the traumatic experience worse, so it is best the physical and mental well-being of the victim be left to a professional,\" she told The Gleaner.\"Children, especially, will have to be taught coping skills to deal with the trauma they encountered.\"At least three communities were thrown into shock this week following separate harrowing events.Anger overtook the residents of Zion, near Falmouth, in Trelawny after two missing boys were found dead. The residents descended on the home of the person they accused of killing the boys, burning it to the ground, killing one relative and injuring another.In Carlton Mountain in Claremont, St Ann, the accusation that an 11-year-old was impregnated by her 63-year-old grand uncle evoked anger and disbelief.Over in Irwin Point, St James, the brutal rape of an eight-year-old girl and four female members of her family was overwhelming for that community.NEED TO DEVELOP COPING MECHANISMSThe psychologist said residents will go through mixed emotions, but it is imperative that they leave the critical aspect of the ordeal to professionals.The victims, she said, should get proper treatment and care in order to develop the necessary coping mechanisms to continue their lives.Clinical psychologist Dr Karen Richards noted that it was imperative that a re-education and reculturalisation be done across communities to reduce the stigma associated with rape, which will help in lessening the trauma for the victim.Richards also stressed that residents must allow the law to take its course.In looking at how to recognise signs of a child being abused, Chambers said community members can be observant and, if they notice something unusual with the child, they can speak to someone they trust or speak to the child to find out what is going on.Both psychologists outlined signs to look for, Chambers noting that \"this is their way of coping, so they hit out in the only way they know how\".Richards, however, warned that all children are different and will, therefore, not exhibit the same signs.\"It is important to note that they may have one or two of these signs but it doesn't necessarily mean they are being abused, so it is important to look at it in totality and not in part,\" she added.anastasia.cunningham@gleanerjm.comWarning signs in a child to pay close attention to: Child begins to exhibit abnormal behaviour opposite to normal behavioural pattern.

The market is more skittish now based on what is taking place in the global economy,\" Hyman said.Speaking in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Phillips said \"all things being equal\", the Government intends to go to the capital market to source funds.Phillips was responding to questions posed by his opposition counterpart, Audley Shaw, on how a matured \u0080200-million (US$265 million) bond in July was settled.He said the payment was settled through the use of loan proceeds of US$150 million that were secured from the National Commercial Bank (NCB) and Scotia Group during the month of July and balances held by the Central Government prior to July 2012.NCB loaned the Government US$100 million while Scotia provided US$50 million. Both loans are issued at a rate of 6.375 per cent and are to be repaid over a period of 18 months.Shaw said the interest rates indicate that the period of the loan itself was very short.\"Normally, we would be looking at replacing loans of this nature, the \u0080200 million, with long-term money ... .

The man was not found, but his stepfather, 43-year-old Donovan Hazley was chopped to death, a female relative seriously injured; and their house set on fire.JCC's WRATHThat vicious mob attack has earned the wrath of the JCC, which described it as, \"heinous and barbarous\".

There is absolutely no justification for such action and the JCC condemns such behaviour.\"However, while the JCC is urging the authorities to investigate the death of the two boys, at least one relative is still adamant that foul play was involved, arguing that the boys were sexually molested and then tossed into the river.\"I saw the bodies and I believe there were signs to suggest they were molested,\" said the relative, who asked not to be identified. \"Drowning might have been the cause of death but they could have been molested first and then thrown into the river.\"adrian.frater@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7687, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fa1dc3697fa50e22", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:49:56.505", "title": "Phillip gives Spelling Bee smashing start", "occurred_at": "2012-09-27T02:07:12", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120926/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Kerry-Ann Hepburn, Children's Own CoordinatorSanta Cruz, St Elizabeth:The Gleaner's Children's Own Spelling Bee 2012-2013 got off to a fine start at the St Michael's Anglican church hall yesterday.The morning saw 52 spellers who came out to represent their schools from all across the parish.It was all systems go and the 'Bees' were ready for the spell down.

It was evident who the favourites were to win and what looked like an obvious win for Harrison turned out to be a three-way battle with Glen Stuart Primary's Labria Parchment and Phillip Williams both involved.The pint-size Labria put up a brave fight, but it was the shy 11- year-old, Phillip, who would be the champion speller for the parish of St Elizabeth, when Harrison failed to correctly spell O-S-C-I-L-L-A-T-E. There was an uproar in the audience when Williams correctly spelt the winning word, O-X-B-O-W.

A shed should have been erected to protect students, the kitchen cupboard should have been fabricated, a kitchen sink installed and water supply connected at the school.Some $1.07 million was set aside to undertake the work, much of which would have flowed back into the hand of the people under the JEEP (Jamaica Emergency Employment Programme).DisappointedPrincipal Beverley Gordon said she was disappointed by the fact that no work has been done at the school to make life more comfortable for the children.\"I am very concerned, because we were promised that something would be done. It was in the papers and that gave us hope but we are still awaiting word from the persons who are in charge of the programme.

It was a matter that an emergency came up, the funds were there and it had to be diverted,\" Dalrymple-Philibert said.The MP further said she would be seeking to use a portion of the Constituency Development Fund to undertake the project at the school.\"That is slow in coming because of the great economic strain.

In 2010, those figures were 78 and 74 years, respectively, the report noted.The PAHO director said differences among countries of the region persist. For example, life expectancy in 2010 was 79.2 in Chile, but only 66.8 in Bolivia, a difference of 12.4 years. These differences are also seen within countries. In Colombia, mortality in children under five in 2010 was 11.3 times greater in the poorest quintile than in the wealthiest.Major demographic trends in the Americas include population growth, urbanisation, and population ageing. In 1900, the population of the Americas was 194 million people; 110 years later, it has risen to over 940 million. It is estimated that by 2020 it will rise to slightly more than one billion inhabitants, representing 13.4 per cent of the global population.Infant mortality Dr Roses pointed out that infant mortality also fell significantly in the last 110 years. One of every four children born in 1900 in Latin America and the Caribbean died before reaching his or her first birthday. Today, 98 per cent survive their first year and have a high probability of reaching old age.The report also stated that in 2006, there were nearly 100 million people over 60 years in the region. By 2020, this figure is expected to double, with more than half of these people living in Latin America and the Caribbean. A projected 69 per cent of all those born in North America and 50 per cent of those born in Latin America and the Caribbean will live beyond the age of 80, the report added.JIS\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7701, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b398ed807696cf4", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:04.395", "title": "US assists Forestry Dept in forest fire management", "occurred_at": "2012-09-26T02:47:30", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120925/lead/lead96.html", "data": "JAMAICA WILL soon have its own Forest Fire Management Programme as attempts are being made to stem the continued loss of key forest resources due to forest fires.Over the last three years, there have been 45 forest fires destroying about 57 hectares of forest.

A passer-by came upon their naked bodies last Thursday.\"The mob burnt down the house, killed the man (Hazley) and attacked the female relative as they are said to be the family members of a man accused of killing the little boys,\" a police source told The Gleaner.\"They are contending that the boys were buggered, but there was no initial information to support this claim.

When the occupants fled from the burning house, Hazley was allegedly chopped to death by men with machetes. His daughter reportedly attempted to intervene and she was also attacked. She has been admitted in hospital.In the CCN release, the police pleaded with residents not to carry out any further acts of vigilante justice or revenge in connection with the deaths of the two boys.Zion is a squatter settlement that is off the North Coast Highway near the outskirts of Falmouth.nagra.plunkett@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7704, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/500416b865bc9bbc", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:05.800", "title": "Illnesses have school officials worried sick", "occurred_at": "2012-09-26T02:47:30", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120925/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Nadisha Hunter, Staff ReporterThere has been an apparent increase in the number of children falling ill with high fever, diarrhoea and vomiting at schools in sections of the island, sparking concerns among principals at some of the institutions.However, when The Gleaner contacted the Ministry of Health yesterday, it was unaware of the illnesses or concerns.Principal of Alpha Infant in Kingston, Nicolette McDonnough-Foster, said five cases have been detected at the school.She said the school was on high alert and continues to take the necessary precautions to lessen the number of children affected.Her concerns came after a five-year-old class-two student from the school died on Sunday following symptoms of fever and diarrhoea.The principal, however, said she was unsure if the boy's death resulted from those symptoms.

The country is also seeking an agreement with the Fund in order to access balance of payment support. CRITICAL ISSUESJamaica had entered into an 18-month standby agreement with the Fund. However, the deal collapsed after the Government failed to honour commitments it had given to the Fund. Those commitments included tax reform, pension reform and a reduction of the public-sector wage bill as a percentage of GDP.Hughes said the IMF yesterday raised those issues as being critical to a new agreement.In the meantime, Hughes said it was unlikely that Jamaica would be seeking a standby agreement from the Fund. He said while the discussions have not reached the point to determine the kind of agreement, the intention of the Government is to secure \"a programme over a long enough period to ensure that we have a real solution to the structural problem that we face\".Representatives of the IMF arrived on the weekend and will be in the country until October 5.

He would still be my Christ.\"The world has been abuzz since last Tuesday's revelation about a scrap of papyrus containing the line in Coptic, \"Jesus said, 'My wife \u0085 '\". Harvard Divinity School Professor Karen King has said that the papyrus fragment is thought to be from the fourth century, but could be a copy of an early gospel from the second century.King, based in Cambridge, Massa-chusetts, revealed that a dealer, who wishes to remain anonymous, brought the fragment to her to be translated and analysed in 2011. Last Tuesday, she presented her findings on the fragment to a conference on Coptic texts held in Rome, Italy, once every four years, which sparked a worldwide debate.The professor speculated that it might have come from a complete gospel she and her research partners have dubbed 'The Gospel of Jesus' Wife'.Blair was quick to point out that every decade or so there appears a new piece of material that speaks about the life of Christ in some form or the other.\"To say that Christ had a wife, I guess the next thing is for persons to now come out and question His lifestyle,\" Blair said when asked his views on King's claims. \"The whole life of Christ seems to be touching on the religiosity of everyone around the world, each one trying to build a case to suit his own perspective.\"IRRELEVANTAlso expressing that whether Jesus had a wife was irrelevant, Pastor Charles Francis of the Faith United Church of God International, said this was neither the first nor would it be the last time someone would come out with claims challenging the long-held doctrines of Christianity. Francis said he views each one with an open mind.\"The Bible does not implicitly state whether He did or not, so I cannot definitively declare it to be true or false. But if it turns out that Christ had a wife, it would not make Him a bad person. It would also change nothing about Him or the fact that He is the Saviour,\" stated Francis.Taking a more adamant stand, the Reverend Dr Lenworth Anglin, executive chairman of the Church of God in Jamaica, said based on the accurate biblical recording of the life of Jesus, with the exception of His missing teenage years, he opposed any view that Jesus had a wife.\"We are very clear that the documentation that we have used over the years are substantial and accurate, which makes no reference to such a claim. Therefore, we hold very strongly to the view that based on internal evidence of scripture, the canon and all the available evidence that we have looked at, Jesus was never married. Any other information would be spurious,\" Anglin stated.anastasia.cunningham@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7708, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/03a6f060baf6c52a", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:07.744", "title": "Bee battle begins", "occurred_at": "2012-09-26T02:47:30", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120925/lead/lead6.html", "data": "The Gleaner's Children's Own Spelling Bee competition kicks off today with parish finals in St Elizabeth and Manchester.

A passer-by came upon their naked bodies last Thursday.\"The mob burnt down the house, killed the man (Hazley) and attacked the female relative as they are said to be the family members of a man accused of killing the little boys,\" a police source told The Gleaner.\"They are contending that the boys were buggered, but there was no initial information to support this claim. The post-mortem was scheduled for today, but we haven't heard anything about the outcome.\"Later yesterday, the Constabulary Communication Network (CCN) revealed the post-mortem concluded that the deaths were caused by drowning. FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS\"However, there are signs to indicate the boys may have been injured before they died,\" the CCN said. \"As a result, crime officer for Area One, Acting Senior Superintendent Derrick Champagnie, has been assigned to head a team that will be conducting more in-depth investigations into the matter.\"Rumours have been rife in Trelawny that Alex and Javani had been sexually molested and then murdered, but the preliminary investigations by the police did not support that notion.Residents were adamant that the person responsible for their demise is from the community of Zion and is related to Hazley.It is understood that Hazley and his family were attacked about 2 a.m. when the mob firebombed their wooden dwelling. When the occupants fled from the burning house, Hazley was allegedly chopped to death by men with machetes. His daughter reportedly attempted to intervene and she was also attacked. She has been admitted in hospital.In the CCN release, the police pleaded with residents not to carry out any further acts of vigilante justice or revenge in connection with the deaths of the two boys.Zion is a squatter settlement that is off the North Coast Highway near the outskirts of Falmouth.nagra.plunkett@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7712, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4ac55aa77ae9157c", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:10.748", "title": "PSOJ places spotlight on 50 under-50 business leaders", "occurred_at": "2012-09-24T00:59:52", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120925/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Nadisha Hunter, Staff ReporterThere has been an apparent increase in the number of children falling ill with high fever, diarrhoea and vomiting at schools in sections of the island, sparking concerns among principals at some of the institutions.However, when The Gleaner contacted the Ministry of Health yesterday, it was unaware of the illnesses or concerns.Principal of Alpha Infant in Kingston, Nicolette McDonnough-Foster, said five cases have been detected at the school.She said the school was on high alert and continues to take the necessary precautions to lessen the number of children affected.Her concerns came after a five-year-old class-two student from the school died on Sunday following symptoms of fever and diarrhoea.The principal, however, said she was unsure if the boy's death resulted from those symptoms.

Yuh betta shut up yuh mout! If yuh eva seh nutt'n, ah wi kill yuh an everybody inna yuh yaad!\" She never said anything about it. In fact, she did not speak a word for a couple days after that incident. That incited a rage attack in her great-aunt who thought the child was just being 'feisty and rude'. Her friends reported that she would suddenly start acting weird and talking \"foolishness\". Yet, when Naomi came back to herself, she remembered nothing. It really got out of hand that day when she suddenly got up and walked out of the math class into the pouring rain. The teacher reported to her great-aunt that Naomi made vulgar gestures and sang loudly, a song with lewd lyrics. Of course, the old lady was furious and gave Naomi a good beating right there at school and swore never to send this \"out of order pickney\" to school again. Furthermore, she starved her for the entire day as punishment. Terrified and embarrassed, Naomi ran away to Aunty Mary's house, only to find Nicholas alone there!Nick's first thought was to ask Naomi to return home.

His brothers-in-the-arms had gone out to hide somewhere else to escape the 'police action'! He called his mother's mobile phone several times, only to get the voicemail. He called 119. The phone rang without an answer. Even his favourite taxi man, 'Dingy', did not answer.

The matter relates to the proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act.Last week a bill was tabled in the House of Representatives which proposes to grant income-tax reprieve to employees of international businesses that establish group headquarters in Jamaica.Dr Peter Phillips, the minister of finance, said the bill was brought to Parliament to honour a commitment given by the previous government.\"There were commitments given against which some companies acted to establish group headquarters in Jamaica,\" Phillips said during the weekly Jamaica House press briefing.\"It is hoped that by facilitating the establishment of group head office companies in Jamaica, other companies will realise the economic benefits, including increased foreign investments, access of alternative capital providers, new markets and the creation of new jobs,\" read the memorandum of objects and reasons.Under the proposed law, companies must apply to the minister of finance for a certificate which designates it as a group head office.The bill proposes, among other things, that the tax exemption cannot be given unless the entity proposes to employ, or already employs at least 30 per cent of its employees from among citizens of Jamaica who are resident in Jamaica.Secure wordPhillips said the Government was \"committed to the idea that the word of the Government of Jamaica ought to be a secure word\".While we understand very well what Phillips is saying, we are most peeved that the country is being told about commitments for tax waivers after a parliamentary committee has considered and agreed on a menu of tax reform proposals.The failure of the former minister Audley Shaw and current minister Phillips to make public the intention to make such an amendment is like putting a blindfold on the people of this country.In particular, we are most disappointed that discussions were held on the issue of tax reform, yet at no point was it ever communicated to stakeholders that such an amendment was in the works. And by not disclosing the intent to   grant this tax reprieve for the setting up of group head offices in Jamaica, both administrations are guilty of deception. But there's no use now whining about the bill being tabled. Instead, we hope the Parliament gets answers. The Gavel is craving the indulgence of members of parliament as we seek to get the real reason an amendment to the Income Tax Act is being proposed. The Parliament must not allow itself to be used as a rubberstamp by the Executive. It should resist the temptation of merely passing the bill because the Government had given its word to investors that it would be granting such exemptions. Questions They must seek to find out the following: On what basis did companies act on promise even before the bill was taken to Parliament? What was the nature of the promises made to international companies for them to set up head office in Jamaica? What benefits, if any, were received by either the government or people acting on behalf of the government? How much tax revenue is being forfeited? How will the country benefit from such an arrangement? Why was the tax reform committee of Parliament not informed of the intention to grant such an exemption? We note that Phillips was unable to indicate the extent to which such massive tax relief could have on the economy. We have no idea if the bill, if passed into law, will be a net gain or net loss for the economy. This newspaper reported that telecommunications company Digicel, which is now building its group headquarters in downtown Kingston, refused to disclose whether it received commitments from the Government for the establishment of its group headquarters in Jamaica, and whether those commitments have been fulfilled. The company, however, said: \"We welcome any initiative that encourages further foreign-direct investment into Jamaica.\" The company added: \"We expect that Digicel will be entitled to avail of the measures contained therein, as will any other company that meets the criteria set out in the legislation that has been tabled.\" Time will tell whether this bill should properly be called the Income Tax (Digicel Amendment) Act 2012. The Gavel is by no way suggesting that the Government does not have a responsibility to woo investors to the country. However, this cannot be at the expense of transparency. At the very least, it is baffling how a government, which has announced a freeze on waivers, just breaches its own rules by promising such a reprieve. One wonders if it would have given similar waivers to local companies which move to remote areas of parishes such as St Thomas and Trelawny to set up shop. The answer: No, it would not because it would be seen as injurious to the tax reform package. Or put another way, there is one rule for the Medes and another of the Persians. We hope to be proven wrong. MPs, please, the country deserves a robust debate on this one. thegavel@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7723, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4d7622b2c9abae81", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:16.692", "title": "Dalrymple-Philibert adds voice to rural bus system concern", "occurred_at": "2012-09-24T00:59:52", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120924/lead/lead94.html", "data": "Daraine Luton, Senior Staff ReporterSOUTH TRELAWNY Member of Parliament (MP) Marisa Dalrymple-Philibert has added her voice to the call for a rural bus system for school children.Dalrymple-Philibert, who is the Opposition spokesman on education, said many parents are experiencing difficulties finding money for transportation for children to school.

There are no programmes basically,\" said Johnson.While backing the call for the Government to pay more attention to these areas, Maia Chung, who heads a foundation bearing her name to assist children with autism and other disabilities, noted that the already steep financial challenges for dealing with some with a disability increases for residents of rural Jamaica who have to travel many miles to seek critical care.\"We just got a severely intellectually disabled person, seven years old, never attended school, whose parent lives in Old Harbour, St Catherine, and there is no facility there so she has to spend $12,000 monthly (on bus fare).\"To (get) therapy (for) her child in Kingston costs $150,000 and she has eight children,\" Chung noted.reliant on gov'tAccording to Chung, the disabled community is reliant on the Government to provide infrastructural development throughout the island.Over the years, a programme dubbed 'Rural Disabilities' has helped to address the strain faced by persons in rural Jamaica, but that has not been enough.\"Even then, that would not go into some of the nooks and crannies where these children are and that is where (you would go) if you want to find children who are shut off,\" said Johnson.Government Senator Floyd Morris, who is visually impaired and who hails from St Mary, agreed that there is a need for more critical-care institutions in rural Jamaica, even as he argued that some intervention has taken place.\"We just got information that pointed to 44 institutions catering to persons with disabilities and children with disabilities across the island,\" Morris declared at the Editors' Forum.He said the number was provided by the Ministry of Education, which provides a number of educational services through entities such as the Jamaica Association for the Deaf and the Caribbean Christian Centre for the Deaf.But Morris noted that the problem facing persons with disabilities in rural Jamaica is compounded by a transportation issue, especially for children with physical disabilities, \"because there is not a public transportation system and the taxis are not modified to transport these individuals\", said Morris.nedburn.thaffe@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7726, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c03e817afdcbc9b0", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:18.061", "title": "Snapped!\n\nFrustrated, some children resort to crime", "occurred_at": "2012-09-24T00:59:52", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120923/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Jodi Gilpin, Sunday Gleaner WriterAbandoned, frustrated and undereducated, some children with mental problems have resorted to violent acts which have led to them being placed in state-operated penal institutions.

Women will seek help earlier, which is one of the reasons breast cancer has a higher survival rate than prostate cancer.\"Men, on the other hand, will have a number of conditions, some of them glaring, but they seek no help for it,\" added Semaj.While not giving numbers, consultant emergency physician at the University Hospital of the West Indies, Dr Romayne Edwards agreed with Semaj.\"There is definitely a problem with males in Jamaica seeking health care. I think it stems from tradition. Men are seen as the stronger sex and they should not have complaints or ills as the women,\" said Edwards.\"Women therefore are usually the ones who get their yearly physicals, attend the doctor with simple complaints and are usually the ones responsible to accompany the children to seek medical attention.\"Therefore, most men tend to ignore the warning signs, they 'watch it' more often and seek home remedies at first, sometimes to their detriment,\" added Edwards.She said as a consequence, the men tend to seek medical attention late or when the sickness is in advanced stages.\"This is even so in educated men and surprisingly even those employed in the health sector.\"increased awarenessAccording to Edwards, there is an increased awareness in Jamaica over the last few years regarding yearly physicals with persons seeking medical attention for their executive profile and their age-specific screening tests to be done.However, the females still outnumber the males by far.\"Males are very afraid of the digital rectal examination which serves as a screening tool for prostate cancer. Some will say it is uncomfortable, degrading and they prefer if it is done by a woman,\" said Edwards.\"Health education is needed with a special emphasis on men's health in Jamaica. This cannot be overstated. This may not prevent cases of sudden death but it will aid in reducing the numbers in those that can be diagnosed and have early intervention.\"Data from a 2009 report published by the National Cancer Intelligence Network and Cancer Research in the United Kingdom confirmed Semaj's claim.According to the report, men are 40 per cent more likely to die from cancer than women and are 70 per cent more likely to be killed by cancers that affect both sexes.The report says this was because men were less willing to switch to healthy lifestyles and were more reluctant to complain to doctors about symptoms during their initial stages.On Tuesday, 43-year-old Orville Heaven, a Meadowbrook High School teacher, collapsed while teaching a class and was pronounced dead at hospital.A day before, sergeant Leachman Gurdon collapsed while at work at the Matilda's Corner Police Station. He was also pronounced dead at the hospital.Medical authorities are yet to determine the cause of both deaths.Dismissing the claim that the deaths could be due to the high stress levels of their jobs, Semaj argued that 80 per cent of visits to health practitioners were precipitated by stress and that the majority of diseases were also triggered by stress, which is always a part of a person's life.According to Semaj, there is a high probability of dying within two years of retirement.\"Man was designed to work, the worst thing he can do is sit home doing nothing, so work in itself is not a stress factor. Anything that exercises your body and mind is good for you,\" Semaj claimed.get regular check-upsThe consulting psychologist said it was imperative that men pay closer attention to their health and get regular check-ups.\"Men need to pay very keen attention to the critical factors of diet, exercise, excess drinking and poor stress management,\" stated Semaj.He was supported by Pastor Charles Francis of the Faith United Church of God International.According to Francis, men need to pay greater emphasis to their physical health coupled with a firm spiritual well-being.\"Having a solid spiritual foundation to stand on will allow someone to deal with stress much better. Faith gives a person that inner peace to deal with anything life throws at them,\" said Francis.\"So, as the Bible teaches, the physical and the spiritual go hand in hand, so it is important to tend to the needs of both, not ignoring one over the other.\"anastasia.cunningham@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7731, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1b1a559fd9698f44", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:21.154", "title": "Textbook blunders plague ministry", "occurred_at": "2012-09-23T02:29:45", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120923/lead/lead6.html", "data": "In November 2007, a Gleaner exclusive revealed that a textbook titled CSEC Home Economics and Beyond (Management) presented same-sex unions as an acceptable family type.The controversial clause in the book authored by Rita Dyer and Norma Maynard, reads: \"When two women or two men live together in a relationship as lesbians or gays, they may be considered as a family.

Three months later the ministry still did not have the book removed from the schools.A month later, The Gleaner again revealed that literature books with curse words ranging from the f-word to the p-word, as well as, local expletives were being used in schools as Caribbean Examinations Council-recommended reading material.Students were exposed to the explicit content from as early as grade nine.

This is the time of year when we get a lot of requests (but) there has been about a 10 per cent increase for the region,\" she said.consult CXCWhen The Sunday Gleaner exposed the illegal trade in Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) grades earlier this month, Giles encouraged employers and educational institutions to consult the CXC if they need to verify any qualification received from prospective employees.At that time, the senior assistant registrar also urged employers and educational institutions to ask prospective employees and students to apply online for a transcript, which would be sent directly to the employer or school.Local companies have been quick to make the checks.\"Companies have taken up the offer and they have been directing employees to get transcripts,\" said Giles during a telephone interview last Thursday.In a sales pitch to a Gleaner reporter, one of the masterminds behind the scam claimed the illegal operation was an inside job.The scammer also claimed that the fake grades would be entered into CXC's database but the regional body has vehemently denied the claims and has stoutly defended the integrity of its system.In addition, Dr Didacus Jules, CXC's chief executive warned that holders of falsified preliminary results slips can be prosecuted.Even though criminals are making $12,000 per subject from their illicit operations, the CXC Act states that anyone found guilty of examination fraud \"shall be liable on summary conviction in a Resident Magistrate's court to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or in default of payment thereof, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months\".While the law seems to offer just a slap on the wrist for offenders, Jules said the council did not take the matter lightly and pledged to explore steps to further tighten its already stringent security measures.Jamaica's education minister, Ronald Thwaites, in response to The Sunday Gleaner's expos\u00e9, described the sale of CSEC passes as scandalous.tyrone.reid@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7733, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4ee8bd266ccfdc36", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:22.136", "title": "Our judges are solid", "occurred_at": "2012-09-23T02:29:45", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120923/lead/lead71.html", "data": "Data shows Privy Council upholding more decisions than it overturnsThe London based Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) upheld just over 61 per cent of the rulings of Jamaica's Appeal Court over the ten year period 2001-2011.Noted attorney-at-law Walter Scott provided that data after an analysis in reaction to claims by fellow attorney Hugh Wildman who weeks ago questioned the quality of the judgments coming out of the local and regional courts.\"It is my considered view that the quality of the judgments given by the Privy Council are far superior to what we are seeing in the region and for that matter what we are seeing coming out of the CCJ (Caribbean Court of Justice),\" Wildman declared at a Gleaner Editors' Forum.\"As it stands now, when one looks at the quality of the judgments coming out of the region, including Jamaica, I cannot say if we were to replace the Privy Council (with the CCJ) that we would be attaining that level of competency,\" Wildman added.But in response Scott argued that the debate over the quality of the judgments from the local courts has been \"a subjective one, layered with emotionalism but devoid of facts\".\"One measure of the quality of the judgments of our Court of Appeal is whether a majority of these decisions are overturned by the JCPC,\" said Scott.\"The facts are that nearly two thirds of the decisions of the Court of Appeal of Jamaica are upheld by the JCPC.

You could rely on him for critical information as it relates to criminals,\" said Superintendent Cornwall 'Bigga' Ford, who learnt his craft from Hewitt.Ford, who now heads the downtown Kingston-based Flying Squad Unit, said it was Hewitt who taught him the art of gathering information and conducting an effective operation.\"While we were at Flying Squad, he would listen to the lowest of ranks. He was a great motivator, and at the time, did a good job of bridging the gap between senior officers and the rank and file. He was the best of the best. His death has left a vacuum,\" said Ford.Retired Deputy Superintendent Althermoth 'Parro' Campbell believes Jamaica should recognise Hewitt, posthumously, for his yeoman service to the police force.\"I remember when we were at the Patrol Division in the early 1970s. Tony Hewitt was a corporal, Renato Adams was an acting corporal, and I was a constable, before Hewitt and I were transferred to Flying Squad.\" Campbell reminisced.KNEW HOW TO TREAT OTHERSHe said among the numerous things that he learnt from Hewitt, was how to treat people without creating any division.\"Sometimes when you popped into Mr Hewitt's office while he was interviewing suspects or wanted persons, you would probably be fooled that they were his family or relatives because of the way he treated them.\"He would provide the best of lunch or whatever they requested that he could afford,\" added Campbell.Deputy Superintendent (DSP) Meveral Smith, who is attached to the St Catherine South Division, served at the Flying Squad with Hewitt in the early 1980s.\"I am yet to see his second. When dispatching you on special assignments, he would provide you with detailed information that was so accurate, down to the last T,\" said Smith.For Smith, the way Hewitt recorded and stored information was immaculate.\"Thirteen years after I left Flying Squad, he was able to pull one of his notebooks, look at his notes, then tell me about my progress over the period. This was when I was called to be informed that I was promoted to the rank of inspector,\" said Smith.Donald Foggarty, another DSP who grew up under the watchful eyes of Hewitt while at Flying Squad, said the veteran taught him what it means to care for others.\"Being around him has helped me to be a better person. Mr Hewitt was a caring man who advised and taught you while on the job. He was very supportive of others,\" said Foggarty.The retired senior officer was gunned down last Sunday, September 16, at the Donmair Apartments, off Red Hills Road, St Andrew. Four persons have since been taken into custody.Last Friday, a family member confirmed that Hewitt will be buried following a thanksgiving service at the Boulevard Baptist Church on Washington Boulevard in St Andrew  on Saturday, October 6.

It is something that the entire principal organisation decides on. If it is to change, it has to go to a general meeting and we vote on it,\" Small told The Gleaner.He said the figure was arrived at based on studies that suggest  that students who consistently perform at a minimum of 45 per cent average in school would usually get at least a grade three in the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) examinations.\"In CSEC, the passes needed to matriculate are one, two and three. Our investigation as principals shows that if students perform consistently with a 45 to 55 per cent average, then it is usually translated in a grade three. If they consistently perform at a 56 to 69 per cent average, then it is usually translated in a grade two, and if they consistently get 70 per cent and over, then it is translated to them getting a grade one.\"So when ISSA said 45 per cent, it means that usually the student would get at least a grade three, which they can use to matriculate,\" Small argued.He, however, said that despite the standard set by ISSA, it was the responsibility of individual institutions to put support systems in place to help students improve.\"If the institutions recognise that students are failing, they need to put support systems in place for those students,\" he said.NO PROBLEM FOR JTAPresident of the Jamaica Teachers' Association (JTA), Clayton Hall, said the criteria set by ISSA was not a problem for the JTA.\"Should the grade be increased, then it would make some of the students who would want to participate ineligible for participation. The reality is that much of these students who may be very successful at ISSA sports are going to earn a living not through academics, but through playing football or running.\"We have to ensure that we don't spare the nose and spoil the face, but we have to work out a balance that will get students at least numerate and literate while they are allowed to play sports,\" he said.\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7736, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ddc7bcd524256af2", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:23.584", "title": "Two more months for Busy Signal", "occurred_at": "2012-09-23T02:29:45", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120922/lead/lead2.html", "data": "United States-based attorney William Mauzy says Jamaican entertainer Busy Signal was \"very happy\" with the six-month jail sentence handed to him in the state of Minnesota yesterday.\"Given all the circumstances, he is very excited that the exit from jail is in sight and that he will be returning to Jamaica,\" said Mauzy, who represented the entertainer, whose real name is Glendale Gordon.According to Mauzy, Busy Signal relayed his feelings during a brief conversation they had after the sentence was announced.Despite the six-month jail term for absconding bail on drug charges dating back to 2002, the entertainer could be freed in 60 days.This after he was given credit for the four months he has been in custody after he was extradited from Jamaica.Mauzy said he had no concern that prosecutors would seek to reinstate drug charges against the entertainer, pointing out that the Extradition Treaty between Jamaica and the United States prohibits them from doing so.\"They cannot prosecute him while he is in the United States for any other offence,\" Mauzy insisted.Mauzy said prison confinement has been \"particularly tough\" on his client.\"He lost a substantial amount of weight and it's an ordeal he is looking forward to being over.\"\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7737, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d7e08c28c274c5bd", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:24.034", "title": "High-school diploma programme coming for adults next year", "occurred_at": "2012-09-23T02:29:45", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120922/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Education Minister Ronald Thwaites said yesterday that his ministry would soon be launching a high-school equivalency diploma for adults.He was speaking at the launch of an essay competition in support of the new civics programme in schools.\"Early in the new year, the Ministry of Education will be rolling out, through the instrumentality of the Jamaican Foundation for Lifelong Learning and the Jamaica Library Service, among other groups, a high-school diploma.

According to Vice-President Delaine Morgan, who spoke at the launch, several sectors benefited from the 2011 experience, including fresh and processed foods, gift and craft, fashion and apparel, information and communication technologies and furniture, among others.SEVERAL SECTORS SEE BENEFIT\"All these sectors benefited tremendously from our presence at JAPEX 2011, primarily the agro-processing and manufacturing sectors, and of the J$100 million in contracts which were generated, agro processing accounted for 41.7 per cent or $42 million while manufacturing accounted for 58.3 per cent or $58 million,\" reported Morgan.She said for this year, the business-linkage event will be strengthened with the launch of both the linkages event and the JAPEX Fair on one online business-matchmaking platform to provide significant opportunities to interact and network. Another new feature will be the business-linkage exhibition and showcase for the duration of JAPEX and a special buyer day on Sunday, September 30 which will allow interactions between representatives of the tourism sector and producers and suppliers of goods and services.Jampro said 40 local suppliers have already been confirmed.According to JHTA President Evelyn Smith, over 220 supplier delegates are expected from Jamaica's six resort areas at the event.She added: \"Approximately 100 tour operator delegates from our traditional markets, United States, Canada and United Kingdom as well as from important emerging markets, including Brazil, Argentina and Chile, will be represented at this event. In addition, 200 retail travel agents from the United States and Canada will also participate in the special trade-show segment of the event.\"In addition, there will be 35 media and travel writers from the United States, Canada, Europe and the Caribbean.ANTICIPATING SUCCESS\"We anticipate great success again from this Jamaican premier marketing event,\" Smith said.Meanwhile, Director of Tourism John Lynch has described Jamaica's tourist industry as poised for a harvest. He said the JTB and partners have been working assiduously to build capacity within the sector to capitalise on the 'Bolt bounce' following the London Olympics.Lynch hailed the benefits of JAPEX saying: \"Beyond the exclusive focus on Jamaica's tourism product, the hosting of the trade show on the island has the added bonus of overcoming travel expenses that often prevent some of our smaller travel partners from showcasing their products overseas. It is a consideration that I am sure is welcomed.\"Last week, general manager at Sunset Jamaica Grande, Clifton Reader, said the hotel was fine-tuning preparations for the event.He said the 17,000 square feet grand hall was ready for occupation by the approximately 150 exhibitors expected at the trade show.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7739, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb08598e79b0673a", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:25.024", "title": "Mothball could foul air quality", "occurred_at": "2012-09-23T02:29:45", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120922/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Christopher Serju, Gleaner WriterAS OF MONDAY, October 1, the importation of mothballs will be regulated by the Pesticides Control Authority (PCA), with an import licence required for each shipment of the product.In a newspaper advertisement last Sunday, the agency advised that from that date, \"Only those naphthalene or para-dichlorobenzene pesticides products (including mothballs) that have been registered by the PCA will be allowed for importation and sale in Jamaica.\"However, the agency will allow for stocks of the product already in the island which conform to Jamaican labelling standards and safety considerations to be sold until depleted.The advertisement goes on to explain that under the Pesticides Act 1975, only pesticides registered by the PCA can be locally manufactured, imported, or sold in Jamaica. Even though sold locally without restriction for many years, mothballs and similar products containing naphthalene or para-dichlorobenzene are now classified as pesticides and therefore subject to regulation by the PCA.INADEQUATE INFORMATION ON LABELSMichael Ramsay, registrar of the PCA, explained that there have been concerns about the inadequate labelling on some of the mothball products. In addition, even where these are labelled, householders and business people fail to read the instructions for use and storage. The PCA is particularly concerned that in the home children could easily access the mothballs and ingest them.Used widely in Jamaican homes to protect clothing from the ravages of moths, Ramsay explained that the two active ingredients which make about 99 per cent of mothballs - naphthalene and para-dichlorobenzene - are, in fact, pesticides. For this reason, they will now fall under the jurisdiction of the PCA.\"Some people use it as an air freshener and widely as a deodorising agent in urinals, but the fumes which make them so effective and popular are a possible health problem, and so mothballs should not be used as an air freshener,\" he advised.The registrar is advising companies engaged in the importation of mothballs to ensure that these are registered with and approved by the PCA and are encouraged to contact the agency for information and guidance on how to proceed.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7740, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f55d9bf2c03c2e8d", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:25.494", "title": "People's Report", "occurred_at": "2012-09-23T02:29:45", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120922/lead/lead7.html", "data": "Rhone Park Estate: a new homeowner's nightmareCONCERNED RESIDENTRhone Park EstateOld Harbour, St CatherineIn light of the recent fire that transpired Thursday, September 13, in the Rhone Park Estate development scheme, I write this letter out of grave concern for my safety, as well as that of my family.The scheme, located in Old Harbour under the development of Mr Norman Horne of ARC, is a new homeowner's nightmare. I say this because of the lack of professionalism in workmanship that has been plaguing the residents of the scheme from the date we moved in to now.According to our sales agreement, we are to make clear any issues with our homes within a set time frame for same to be resolved. To date, I have issues still pending and, unfortunately, a neighbour has lost all her belongings and her home to what seems like an electrical problem.Upon leaving the scheme on Friday, September 14, a CVM news team was there filming the scene. Electrical problems are but one of the issues affecting this scheme. In some houses, once you turn on your ceiling fans, you can hear and see gashes from the switch, which has been referred to ARC in previous emails.From cracks in the houses, light flickering, to fixtures falling apart, to begging for top soil, shabby roadwork that leaves rainwater backing up. And the big whopper, of course, is our recreational area, which has turned into a biodigester. So instead of jointly owning a recreational area, the residents are now proud owners of our sewage system.I am tired of calling and writing Mr Horne and his staff. The level of disrespect, in terms of neglect, is appalling. How could ARC feel good about the condition that this scheme is in?Wall cracks have had to be plastered over.Robins Bay water woes driving residents up the wallBRIGITTA FUCHSLOCHER-COXRobins Bay/Strawberry FieldsWe each have a house by Strawberry Fields and, since April 2012, we are hardly ever getting water. Although we are complaining to the National Water Commission (NWC) customer service almost on a daily basis, speaking to supervisors and regional managers, there has been no improvement.The Robins Bay/Strawberry Fields area has multiple leaks on the main pipe, which we reported to the NWC, without seeing repair work done.As far as we know, we are supposed to get water three times a week for 12 hours. We can see, by watching the leaks, that water is in our region once a week for a few hours, much too little to ever reach Strawberry Fields, which is at the end of the main water pipe.Apart from us, there is a community of property owners here in Strawberry Fields who bought lots in recent years. Some already have water connections by the NWC and some are intending to get one. Those people, many from abroad and returning residents, spent a good amount of money to buy their property and build houses, and would improve the general outlook of the area of Robins Bay/Strawberry Fields.But without regular water supply, there is absolutely no way that this area could improve, as many of the property owners are thinking of reselling because of the water situation.Customer No. 1186912; Premises No. 1186902HEIDEMARIE KUPITZCustomer No. 1345395; Premises No. 1345385Pulled over, plates seized: Motorists being used to fill coffers?C.M.Salt Hill, Content GapEast Rural St AndrewOn Friday afternoon, August 24, as we were accompanying our family to catch a flight at the Norman Manley International Airport, we were stopped by a policeman and instructed to pull over into an abandoned gas station.There was no apparent reason, as we had not been speeding; but we complied. Our vehicle was then subjected to a 'random fitness check' by an inspector from one of the motor vehicle examination depots, as part of an 'operation' seemingly set up by both blue- and red-seam police.After the examination, just as we thought, the inspector was about to return our documents to us, he suddenly looked down and declared that our left front tyre was defective. Without further ado, he instructed that the licence plates be removed immediately and a traffic ticket and certificate of defect issued.We were assured that we could drive for 24 hours without plates; but were still completely taken aback by this drastic action, as we were indeed in possession of a valid certificate of fitness.The following Monday, having paid the fines (amounting to $12,700) and replaced the defective tyre ($11,000), we were issued a certificate of defect remedied, and told we could retrieve our licence plates at the Elletson Road Police Station. After two unsuccessful visits and several phone calls, and to no fewer than four other local police stations, and also to both examination depots to try to locate the plates, we finally learned (from a very helpful gentleman at the Transport Authority) that they were at the Island Special Constabulary Force headquarters at Harman Barracks.WHAT'S THE POINT?We finally retrieved the plates on September 4, after further delay, once the inspector was able to locate the key to the room where they were being kept.As instructed, I attempted to turn in the certificate of defect remedied to the Kingston collectorate in order to \"remove the ban on the licence plates\", but was told that the original certificate of defect had not yet been logged into the system and, this would not be done for a couple more months, I was told I should simply keep this document with the other car papers. So what was the point?This was, to say the least, a very untidy operation and, I have been since reliably informed, also an illegal one. Inspections of vehicles should only be carried out at authorised depots. I consider this type of behaviour, therefore, to be pure harassment. If the tyre was, indeed, defective, as a motorist, it was my duty to replace it in a timely manner.We should have been given an opportunity to remedy the situation that afternoon, considering that we were in possession of a valid certificate of fitness.Are people being pulled over with a view to making our roads safer, or are we pawns in a quota-driven game to fill the country's coffers? What is the sense in having a fine imposed and also having one's licence plates removed?What can another law-abiding citizen, one who is barely eking out an existence, do in such a situation, if he or she is fined and also deprived of his means of transportation?There must be methods of ensuring compliance other than stopping people for illegal on-the-spot inspections, removing plates, and causing drama and frustration.And finally, what sanctions can be imposed on the officers involved in these ongoing 'illegal' operations?Declare Jamaica a bird sanctuaryMAJOR JOHNATHAN LAMEY (JP)President, Portland Environmental Protection AssociationI read with a heavy heart the notice put out by the National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA) regarding the 2012 bird-shooting season. Not only did my heart really go out for the poor little harmless birds that will fall prey of these 'wicked rich shottas', but my mind reflected on the days when notices similar to this were placed in other print media and elsewhere regarding hunting so-called 'Negro slaves' for a paltry fee.The hunt was for those who had no voice or say in their destiny; same as it is for the innocent little birds who only want to live, raise their own 'families' and, in the process, pollinate the plants along with the bees, propagate certain plant seeds by scarifying them in their digestive systems to enhance their germination (pimento seeds are so done by the dove species that are on the published list by NEPA to be hunted and killed) - all this to benefit humans.The Wild Life and Protection Act must be amended to protect these little feathered creatures, most of which are migratory birds escaping the harsh weather conditions from North America and elsewhere. If the entire island of Jamaica is declared a bird sanctuary, it will not only protect our species of birds, but it could mean more tourist dollars for our cash-strapped country.The Ornithology Society will tell you that birdwatching is a multimillion-dollar industry and pastime. Bird shooting, on the other hand, brings in unwanted weaponry that often fuels crime (many legal firearms are stolen and thus end up in the wrong hands!).Many visitors to our beautiful island might be encouraged to return at a particular time of the year just to watch their favourite bird species. Why not add birdwatching to our list of attractions for both Jamaicans and visitors alike? The only tools that might be required are a pair of binoculars and a camera!'LEGAL GUNMEN'The notice issued by NEPA not only stated the various doves that can be killed, but stated the time when these 'legal gunmen' can carry out their acts of violence; for example, \"from sunrise to 9 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. to sunset on Saturdays, and from sunrise to 9 a.m. on Sundays.\" Does NEPA realise that many hard-working Jamaicans who toil from Monday to Friday are still in bed up to 9 a.m. on weekends?The sad thing is, these 'shottas' don't kill the birds for food, but, in the name of so-called 'fun'. What is this teaching them to do later? To hold no respect for life and to wantonly snuff out lives for the sake of fun?And what are the pellets from the bullets doing to our surface and underground water supply? Has NEPA carried out a study on this? What about the safety of innocent campers, joggers and hikers who might be in the affected area?Let us urge NEPA to get in high gear to promulgate plans for phasing out the bird-killing season and, instead, herald in the birdwatching season, which is safe to all and is ecologically friendly.majorlampat@yahoo.comFix and cover open Spanish Town drains, Mr MayorVery Upset ParentSpanish Town, St CatherineThis is an open letter to the mayor of Spanish Town, Norman Scott. I am writing this letter on behalf of my daughter who fell into an open drain on a sidewalk and was injured in the process.In the late evening of Thursday September 13, 2012, she was on her way home after a heavy downpour in Spanish Town. Just across from the bus/taxi park and in the vicinity of the second mini plaza complex, she was walking on the sidewalk when she suddenly fell, chest first, to the ground.Her right leg had gone into the open drain filled with dirty, black water. She was assisted by a passer-by who helped her out of the hole. She was soaked from the chest down, her jeans pants ripped, revealing a long gash/cut of about four inches on her right shin (see accompanying photos). There was also a large bruise on her left, upper leg and scrapes on her left elbow and she later had to seek medical attention.Recently, on television, there was an incident of a student falling into one of those drains and tales of many others experiencing this horror. When will these drains be fixed or properly covered? Are we to await a fatality before anything is done?Just seeing the kind of water and garbage that run through these drains is enough to make your skin crawl, so can you then imagine being immersed in this water? I am so upset!kmine_gold@yahoo.comTell us about the positives and negatives affecting your community, school or any other social space.

It must protect them from the discriminatory practice,\" Brown argues.The government senator noted that the Insurance Association of Jamaica told the committee that insurers have no objection to providing insurance to members of the disabled community who have driver's licences. He also noted that the association said it did not discriminate against persons because they are disabled.Under the law, deaf people as well as persons who have lost the use of both legs are eligible for driver's licences.Opposition Senator Arthur Williams, however, said insurance companies \"have a right to rate different people at a higher risk\".He said charging members of the disabled community a higher premium for insurance coverage might be guided by the perceived risks involved.Similarly, Opposition Senator Alexander Williams argued that it would not be appropriate for such laws to be enacted against insurance companies.\"They have to measure their risk and I think it would be a dangerous and slippery slope to necessarily brand their assessment of risk as discriminatory conduct,\" Williams said.He further argued that the Charter of Rights protects all persons from discrimination and that persons who feel wronged can apply to the courts for redress.daraine.luton@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7748, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b7dbb8f300453b22", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:29.314", "title": "NEWS BRIEFS", "occurred_at": "2012-09-23T02:29:45", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120921/lead/lead9.html", "data": "Police confirm two bodies as missing Trelawny boys WESTERN BUREAU:The Falmouth police have confirmed that two bodies that were found in the Martha Brae River in Trelawny yesterday are those of 10-year-old Alex Brown and seven-year-old Javani Brown.Reports are that a caretaker for a nearby property stumbled upon the two youngsters' nude bodies and alerted the police.Alex, a grade-six student of Falmouth All-Age School, and Javani, a grade-one student at Hague Primary School, had gone missing from their homes in Zion district, near Martha Brae, last Saturday.Marshall Brown, Javani's father, recalled that he last saw his son at home on Saturday morning at 10:30.\"I gave my son something to eat, about 10:30 a.m., and he was in the yard, and I don't know when he and the other little boy leave.

Monroe requested an X-ray to confirm the diagnosis and to ascertain the exact location of the abdominal obstruction.Bownaifair testified that Monroe performed an emergency surgery, but he did none of the things for which he had scheduled the emergency surgery.He did not treat the intussusception, which is an inversion of one portion of the intestine within another, or the intestinal polyp. Monroe instead removed her appendix and did not tell her. There was a recurrence of the symptoms which had affected her before the surgery and she sought medical advice and assistance.On August 7, 2006, Dr Lucien Tomlinson performed the correct surgery.UNWARRANTED REMOVALJustice Donald McIntosh, in handing down judgment in favour of the claimant, said he found that Monroe's removal of the claimant's appendix was unwarranted and unnecessary. He said that Monroe's negligence caused the claimant to undergo a second surgery.Attorneys-at-law Andr\u00e9 Earle and Kelly Greenway, who represented the claimant, had argued that based on the evidence of the claimant and expert witness Dr Derrick Mitchell, the judge should find that Monroe was negligent.Monroe, who was represented by attorneys-at-law David Batts and Miguel Williams, denied he was negligent and said his treatment of the patient met the standard of care.He called Dr Tevor McCartney and Dr Patrick Bhoorasingh to testify as expert witnesses.McIntosh said, simply put, the defendant failed to make an adequate incision to properly examine the claimant's intestines for the intussusuception and/or the catalysis polyp. He also found that Monroe routinely removed the claimant's appendix based on discoloration, which should have evidently resulted from the barium meal test. He said the doctor did not inform the claimant that he had merely removed her appendix and had failed to remove her intussusceptions and catalytic polyp.The judge said he was at a loss as to why Monroe did not take the advice of his friend, McCartney, to \"settle quickly\".barbara.gayle@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7751, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5de51ab831dfc05e", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:31.383", "title": "Accused throat slasher deemed mentally ill", "occurred_at": "2012-09-21T06:50:30", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120921/lead/lead94.html", "data": "The trial of the man accused of slashing the throat of a policeman at the entrance to Jamaica House in December 2009 could not proceed Wednesday in the Home Circuit Court because he is mentally ill.Supreme Court judge Sarah Thompson-James issued a bench warrant for 26-year-old Andre Pratt but stayed it until October 16.Pratt, who is charged with wounding with intent, was not at court.Attorney-at-law Valerie Neita-Robertson, who is representing Pratt, told the court that he was mentally ill and could not attend court.

Adults are aggressive, they earn money, they vote, so they get all the attention and the children who are not learning in class and the ones giving trouble in class are just seen as troublemakers,\" he said.\"In the southeast region where I work, you might have 50,000 children with different types of mental problems such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and so on, and we have only about six persons, including myself, who are working full time with them.

He said while he was mindful of the financial constraint facing the Government, it has a responsibility to do whatever it takes to find solutions to cater to these kinds of children.\"The Government will definitely have to advocate, request, pressure, beg to do more for these children and, at the same time, we have to find some creative ways of finding some resources.\"In an attempt to further shed light on the extent of the problem, Shetty said during the aftermath of the 2010 west Kingston unrest, he was the only psychiatrist summoned by the Government to go into Tivoli Gardens to identify children suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.\"We screened over 200 children who had post-traumatic stress disorder and I was the only one who could go there. Ninety per cent of children with post-traumatic stress disorder do not come to child guidance clinic. Ninety per cent of them are untreated and unidentified and even the ones who do come, they fill up our books and we are struggling to see them on a regular basis in order to be effective,\" he said.In the meantime, special educator and founder of the Adonijah Group of Schools for Intellectual Disabilities, Ruthlyn James, said one of the measures the Government could institute to plug the shortfall is to train more social workers to help identify and treat children suffering from the different types of mental illness.She added that there was also a need for the Government to train police officers to deal with children who are suffering.\"When they are left untreated and the parents don't know what to do with them, they turn them over to the state and the state will, most times, just keep them there and they will not be offered any therapy,\" James lamented.nedburn.thaffe@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7754, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0267e3702f61d7a0", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:32.738", "title": "Hewitt's death believed to be a contract killing", "occurred_at": "2012-09-21T06:50:30", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120921/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Glenroy Sinclair, Assignment CoordinatorAs senior detectives await the results of a forensic examination, preliminary investigations suggest that the death of retired Senior Superintendent Tony Hewitt could have been the result of a contract killing.While declining to say much at this time, detectives probing the incident said they are now following strong leads.

Adults are aggressive, they earn money, they vote, so they get all the attention and the children who are not learning in class and the ones giving trouble in class are just seen as troublemakers,\" he said.\"In the southeast region where I work, you might have 50,000 children with different types of mental problems such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and so on, and we have only about six persons, including myself, who are working full time with them. Some are social workers, some are psychologists and I am the only child psychiatrist in the government system for the entire southeast region where half of Jamaica resides,\" he lamented. He said while he was mindful of the financial constraint facing the Government, it has a responsibility to do whatever it takes to find solutions to cater to these kinds of children.\"The Government will definitely have to advocate, request, pressure, beg to do more for these children and, at the same time, we have to find some creative ways of finding some resources.\"In an attempt to further shed light on the extent of the problem, Shetty said during the aftermath of the 2010 west Kingston unrest, he was the only psychiatrist summoned by the Government to go into Tivoli Gardens to identify children suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.\"We screened over 200 children who had post-traumatic stress disorder and I was the only one who could go there. Ninety per cent of children with post-traumatic stress disorder do not come to child guidance clinic. Ninety per cent of them are untreated and unidentified and even the ones who do come, they fill up our books and we are struggling to see them on a regular basis in order to be effective,\" he said.In the meantime, special educator and founder of the Adonijah Group of Schools for Intellectual Disabilities, Ruthlyn James, said one of the measures the Government could institute to plug the shortfall is to train more social workers to help identify and treat children suffering from the different types of mental illness.She added that there was also a need for the Government to train police officers to deal with children who are suffering.\"When they are left untreated and the parents don't know what to do with them, they turn them over to the state and the state will, most times, just keep them there and they will not be offered any therapy,\" James lamented.nedburn.thaffe@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7760, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bd2d52af5755249c", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:35.389", "title": "Bartlett chides permanent secretary for missing House committee meeting", "occurred_at": "2012-09-21T06:50:30", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120921/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Glenroy Sinclair, Assignment CoordinatorAs senior detectives await the results of a forensic examination, preliminary investigations suggest that the death of retired Senior Superintendent Tony Hewitt could have been the result of a contract killing.While declining to say much at this time, detectives probing the incident said they are now following strong leads.

A clear signal needs to be given as to how the funds are allocated and what amount can be allocated to a specific programme,\" Campbell stated.Committee Chairman Dr D.K. Duncan supported the call for some element of public education on the CDF.\"This issue has arisen because of many other complex factors which have very little to do with the CDF itself, except that at the outset there were certain forces in the society who were not in favour of the CDF, no matter how it was run,\" Duncan asserted.Debate on the use of the CDF has intensified in the media following a fallout between East Rural St Andrew MP Damion Crawford and some of his constituents, supposedly over the spending of the CDF on mainly education programmes.MPs have been allocated $15 million under the CDF to spend on projects in their constituencies this parliamentary year.

We have actually taught drug abuse and sex education in schools for quite a long time, and from our standpoint, the questions posed are in no way leading to the development of a good habit or knowledge about sexual reproductive health that we want to teach our students,\" Hall said.The JTA president noted that the way forward rests solely with the Ministry of Education which, he said, must do due diligence to ensure that things to be published, especially those things that are to find their way into schools, go through proper checks and balances.\"From the association standpoint, we will remain vigilant and we will continue to review any new documents placed in our schools and provide the relevant feedback to the agencies and groups responsible for their introduction and correction,\" concluded Hall.barrington.flemming@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7768, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/82d6300f3a9d8a4b", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:46.313", "title": "Montego Bay kidnapping trial on hold", "occurred_at": "2012-09-20T03:43:44", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120920/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Christopher Thomas, Gleaner WriterWESTERN BUREAU:The much-anticipated trial of the four persons charged in connection with the May 2011 kidnapping of a Mount Alvernia Preparatory School student has been postponed until September 24 to allow the defence lawyers time to confer with their clients.The four accused - 23-year-old cabinetmaker Jonathan 'Clevaugn' Mitchell of Spaldings, Clarendon; 22-year-old barber Trevon Tomlinson of Cornwall Courts, Montego Bay; 26-year-old counsellor Jenise Regisford of Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States and Cornwall Courts, Montego Bay; and a 17-year-old minor of Paradise, Montego Bay - had their bails extended.The quartet has been charged with kidnapping, conspiracy to kidnap and conspiracy to extort arising from the much-publicised incident.LAWYERS AWAITING INSTRUCTIONSAttorney-at-law Martyn Thomas, who is representing Regisford, explained to presiding High Court judge Martin Gayle that the defence lawyers needed to take further instructions from their clients.\"We have been having some discussions, and we would need some time to take further instructions from our clients and to advise them further,\" said Thomas. \"We just want to have the opportunity to have those discussions.\"After consulting with lead prosecutor Jeremy Taylor, Gayle set the matter to start on September 24.The charges stem from the kidnapping of a three-year-old child on the afternoon of May 3, 2011.

The minister said it would generate economic activity which can spur economic growth.\"It is a win-win situation. It does provide a certain incentive and what it does is bring business, which is not here now, to come, potentially,\" Phillips said.The minister was unable to state the extent to which the country's revenue of GDP would be enhanced if Parliament approves the amendment to the Income Tax Act.daraine.luton@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7770, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/906ddcec1e740197", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:47.171", "title": "Public-sector unions hopeful as wage, benefits talks begin today", "occurred_at": "2012-09-20T03:43:44", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120920/lead/lead7.html", "data": "Gary Spaulding, Senior Gleaner WriterUnion leaders have declared they expect the Portia Simpson Miller administration to bring something beneficial to the negotiating table to make up for its inability to accommodate a wage hike for public-sector workers as they enter into high-level talks today.The administration is expected to formally place a no-wage-hike proposal on the table when minister without portfolio in the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service, Horace Dalley, meets with union leaders at the Jamaica Conference Centre in downtown Kingston.Prominent union leaders have confirmed with The Gleaner that they have been approached informally with the no-wage-hike offer, but stressed that they have not communicated this to their membership as the information was not official.

They said it does not capture all the relevant assistance projects being undertaken in constituencies.Reacting to yesterday's lead story in The Gleaner, some parliamentarians stressed that they have spent millions of dollars more on peripheral educational programmes in their constituencies.Member of Parliament for South East St Andrew Julian Robinson has sought to clear the air on the discrepancy between the figures listed in a document The Gleaner received through the CDF and another he released Monday.Robinson said the $3 million listed in the CDF document as education spending in his constituency is complemented by another $3 million he spent on a summer reading programme, which the CDF did not place in the same category.DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION\"The figures provided by me include monies which have not been captured under the heading 'Education' \u0085 by the CDF.

So, in my own case, education would have emerged as $3.1 million, but having spent an additional $3 million on my summer camp, which was an educational programme, that was added to the figure, bringing it to in excess of $6 million.\"On the face of it, veteran Member of Parliament for East Central St James Edmund Bartlett does not appear to be a big spender on education. However, he stressed that he forked out $10 million this year alone on a scholarship programme he transferred from the Eastern St Andrew constituency he represented between 1980 and 1993.\"We couldn't do it alone with the $4 million from the CDF and that is why we have partnered with the private sector. Every year, East Central has a major fund-raiser for education to strengthen the education fund,\" Bartlett told The Gleaner. \"The other $6 million comes from private sector support.\"Bartlett stressed that education for the people he has served has been his main thrust over the past 32 years.\"We have developed a comprehensive education programme for the building of the human capital in the constituencies that I have served,\" Bartlett asserted.He said the $10 million spent on the scholarship programme was the largest in its 32-year history, administered by an education council that is headed by the principal of the John Rollins Success Primary School, Yvonne Miller Wisdom.\"The council consists of the principals of all the schools, including high, in the constituency,\" said Bartlett.SKILLS-TRAINING PROGRAMMENewcomer to representational politics, the Member of Parliament for North West St Ann, Dayton Campbell, told The Gleaner that he has pumped more into educational endeavours than is reflected in the CDF.\"I have already spent $4.5 million assisting with tuition and other education-related fees,\" said Campbell. \"I have another programme valuing $5.1 million, which will be administered through the HEART Trust/NTA, to facilitate skills training at the community level.\"Campbell also pointed to the establishment of homework centres in 10 communities across North West St Ann.\"I gave out 1,500 back-to-school vouchers for books and uniforms with a denomination of $2,000 each \u0085 .

Among those successes are job creation for 4,614 persons, building 600,000 square feet of production space together with 87,500 square feet of space for Government offices, the installation of traffic signals at 12 intersections and also meeting the health needs of the residents.MOVING FORWARD\"We did this during the 1980s quite successfully, and our plan is to do it again at a time in which everyone is trying to determine how to move our nation forward,\" he said.\"All of us from the public and private sectors will have to learn how to contribute to this forward movement of our economy and not to look back at the mistakes that we might have made,\" he said.Alluding to the then Desnoes and Geddes which, in 1986, donated its old headquarters to the restoration effort (for J$500), he said the different sectors should aim to follow on the same path.\"Today, that building is home of a vibrant furniture manufacturing company employing 27 employees, the ROKTOWA Limited, an agency that has an artistic residency programme for both fine and applied arts, restoring our people as well as home to a social outreach of Red Stripe itself,\" he explained.nadisha.hunter@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7777, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eedb492cb50e94dd", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:50:50.278", "title": "'Bolt bounce' brings in more UK visitors as election grounds American tourists", "occurred_at": "2012-09-20T03:43:44", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120919/lead/lead9.html", "data": "Barrington Flemming, Gleaner WriterWESTERN BUREAU:The spin-off from athletics superstar Usain Bolt's exploits at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, England could counter the expected fall-off in visitors from the United States (US), who generally show a reluctance to travel during the presidential election season in their country.Director of Tourism John Lynch said while the election period in the US could spell some painful days for Jamaica, the island has begun to gain traction in the United Kingdom (UK) market and should see a boost in arrival figures.\"I am encouraged by the UK, in particular, which is doing well,\" said Lynch. \"We have the 'Bolt bounce' over there and the airlines are pretty bullish.

Of those 20 cases, 13 were for rape, four for carnal abuse, two for incest, and one for a sexual act with a person under the age of 16.True to Scott's observation, the number of sex-related cases shows an increase over last year's figure. In last year's Michaelmas sitting of the St James Circuit Court, of the 32 overall matters listed, there were 19 cases relating to sexual matters.\"The trend in St James is worrying. We need to really look at what is happening, what information is getting to these people, and where it is connected to the general social and moral degradation and breakdown in the society,\" said Scott.In putting the matter into a national perspective, the family therapist said there was a heightened sensitivity toward sex among the nation's youth because of how the subject is approached in the media.\"It's all because of how sex is portrayed in social media, on TV, and in the electronic media,\" she said. \"Children and youth have access to every kind of sexual preferences, innuendos and information on the World Wide Web.

Suffering the agonising pangs of hunger so many many nights, Thomas said sometimes he and his siblings were so hungry, they felt they were going to die. They depended on the mercies of an aunt who sold soup in the town, who would feed them with the leftover she had.At age 14, while at Spanish Town Secondary School, he had an encounter with someone special who would lead him to fulfil his destiny.\"She was a godsend who changed my life. She made me believe that anything was possible, that I could do anything I set my mind to. I now understood that where I came from and what I went through did not determine my future,\" he shared with The Gleaner.\"That was the most important lesson I learnt in my life: Christ plus education equalled success.\"HIS CALLINGThe inspiration of that Christian woman heavily influenced his decision to pursue the path of pastorship.

It stands to reason that there is the potential for behavioural problems, so we are hoping that the boys may be able to go and sit and talk with the chaplain and receive some advice and guidance.

He urged the NWC to outsource some of its operations in order to improve efficiency.SEVERE WATER PROBLEMSService was critical of the authorities pumping millions of gallons of water per day to St James from the Martha Brae River while the people in the parish were experiencing severe water problems.Donovan White, councillor for the Duncans division, expressed disgust at the NWC for the inconsistent water supply the people of Spicy Hill are currently experiencing. He said they only get water 12 hours each day.In his response, NWC Parish Manager Orville Williams told White that the underground water source in his area is producing less than half the amount of water it once produced. As a result, the pump cannot function for 24 hours on the low water pressure.In respect of the other concerns, Williams instructed the council to write to the NWC for answers because he was not in a position to deal with them.rural@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7794, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fdd5d6ec2385306f", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:51:03.585", "title": "Garbage collection issues plague St James", "occurred_at": "2012-09-19T04:26:04", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120918/lead/lead93.html", "data": "Sheena Gayle,Gleaner WriterWESTERN BUREAU:AT LEAST two councillors in the St James Parish Council are urging the National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) to cease the commercial collection of garbage.The position of the councillors came to the fore during last Thursday's regular monthly meeting at the St James Parish Council, where it was revealed that more than 60 domestic collection points in communities across the parish are experiencing serious backlog, creating a public-health hazard.According to Homer Davis, the councillor for the Cambridge division, the inconsistency by NSWMA in collecting domestic waste is attributed to the fact that the agency is busy throughout the day trying to service the contracts of collecting commercial waste, which, in effect, affects how soon residents have their garbage collected.\"A serious approach is needed to deal with the problems that have plagued the city and its environs for far too long,\" said Davis. \"The NSWMA needs to allow private companies to collect the commercial waste in the city and focus on the domestic waste. I think that will greatly improve the reliability of collections by the authority.\"In a report submitted to the parish council for the period July 26 to August 25, the NSWMA admitted that residential solid-waste collection was not done in keeping with the authority's standard, which the agency said was primarily due to downtime/unavailability of both company-owned and supplementary units.The report further stated that all of the 61 areas had experienced a backlog in the collection of waste and an overflow of receptacles.LACK OF ENFORCEMENTCouncillor Glendon Harris, chairman of the St James Parish Council and mayor of Montego Bay, concurred with Davis and further added that businesses were dumping garbage in undesignated areas, contributing to the agency's backlog problems.\"The enforcement team is not working at all. We cannot continue like this,\" Harris stated. \"The truth of the situation is what when I travel downtown at various hours of the day, I find that commercial garbage is being deposited at skips that were not designated for those waste.\"He added: \"As a result, the NSWMA trucks have to be working on the streets around the clock.

As we say, one, one coco full basket,\" Simpson Miller told thousands of supporters during her first conference speech since returning to office as head of government last December.Simpson Miller said her administration welcomed new investment by the Dolphin Cove group, which was working on a new dolphin attraction and an animal park. This, she said, was expected to create well-needed jobs.Additionally, she noted the West Kingston Power Partners' ongoing construction of a 66-megawatt energy plant; Hinduja Global Solutions, which started an information communication technology (ICT) project last month; Vistaprint, which expanded its ICT operations; and Sutherland Global, a call centre out of India, which is slated to begin operations in Jamaica next month.7,000 jobs this yearAccording to the prime minister and PNP president, these investments will generate nearly 7,000 jobs this year.Turning to the state of the country's economy, Simpson Miller conceded that Jamaica's economic situation at this time \"is not good\", but noted that it was not irredeemable.She vowed to reduce the current poverty levels, which spiked from less than 10 per cent in 2007 to some 20 per cent in 2011 under the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP).\"I am determined to bring it back down,\" she declared.\"We have to deal with the economic situation. We have to fix it. We have to get it right,\" the PNP president asserted.Simpson Miller blasted Opposition Spokesman on Finance Audley Shaw for pressing the Government to correct the country's serious debt woes in nine months after, she said, he failed to tackle the problem in four years. She accused the JLP of moving the debt from $900 billion to some $1.7 trillion.The prime minister pointed out that the country had to spend 58 per cent of the entire Budget to pay debt this fiscal year.\"That is the situation we have inherited. The Government has little money to do anything. That is the plain truth and I am here to tell you the truth.\"Commenting on the elusive International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement, Simpson Miller said her administration had to restart talks with the fund when it took the reins of power, as the programme \"had broken down\" under the JLP government.According to Simpson Miller, the former finance minister had failed to implement IMF conditionalities while he was in office. She said this denied the country the opportunity to draw down on billions of dollars.\"They broke it. Now we are the ones who will have to fix it.\"She said her administration was \"pushing as hard as we can to complete negotiations for a new IMF agreement as soon as possible\".The head of government shied away from providing a specific timeline for inking an agreement with the fund. \"Every negotiation is a process. It is a delicate give-and-take and that takes time. It is difficult to provide a definitive date for an IMF agreement and we do not intend to make any predictions or pronouncements.\"She stressed that the signing of an IMF agreement was critical to enhancing investor confidence and pivotal in unlocking hundreds of millions in foreign-exchange inflows from a number of international agencies.She said the inflows were crucial in maintaining the country's net international reserves (NIR) and to keep the dollar stable.The NIR has been declining in recent times to approximately 15 weeks of imports, while the dollar has been depreciating against its US counterpart, reaching a record level of about J$90 to US$1.\"We know that we have to make some difficult choices today in order to have a better tomorrow.\"Targeting housing development as a means of stimulating economic development, the prime minister said her government would be providing affordable housing solutions for Jamaicans.She has given instructions for new emphasis in six major areas to include more housing for deep rural communities.

Hewitt managed to reach into his car, grabbed his licensed firearm and took on the gunmen.\"One of the bullets also grazed his abdomen,\" one of the investigators at the crime scene told The Gleaner yesterday.Reprisal for recent shoot-outInformation reaching The Gleaner is that the attack on Hewitt was a reprisal for a recent incident in which a man from a nearby community was shot by the police.Yesterday afternoon, National Security Minister Peter Bunting expressed regret at the reported shooting. \"Mr Hewitt was a well-known crime fighter who has distinguished himself in service to the Jamaica Constabulary Force and Jamaica,\" Bunting said in a release. \"His family has the support of the Ministry of National Security in this difficult time.\"Bunting urged the security forces to act swiftly in their investigations and took the opportunity to remind the public to exercise vigilance as they carry out their daily activities, and to assist the police with any information that could lead to the apprehension of the perpetrators of Hewitt's shooting and any other crime. Commenting on the incident, Police Commissioner Owen Ellington also condemned the attack and urged investigators to work tirelessly to bring those responsible to justice. Hewitt is one of the senior investigators at the Firearm Licensing Authority. He was the commanding officer for the Flying Squad Unit in downtown Kingston for many years, the Special Anti-Crime Task Force and a number of elite teams, which originated out of the Criminal Investigation Branch.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7798, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/298a0b6a79f0a314", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:51:05.991", "title": "Strong support, but small crowd at PNP confab", "occurred_at": "2012-09-19T04:26:04", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120917/lead/lead4.html", "data": "Daviot Kelly, Staff ReporterIt was the usual sea of orange, red and yellow that you would expect from a People's National Party (PNP) conference, but some attendees believed the magic wasn't quite there.More than a few self-described Comrades felt the crowd at the National Arena was smaller this year.

Phillips has also announced that the long overdue White Paper on tax reform will be tabled later this month, and last week the House approved the removal of 3,000 posts from the civil service.But an issue which policymakers appear to have avoided, almost like a plague, is that of the salaries being paid to public-sector workers in relation to the quality of work being done.The Gavel is unrepentant in the view that not only is the public sector overstaffed, but also many of the persons there lack the necessary skills to add value to the entity to which they are employed.As a result, taxpayers have been paying a huge cost for inefficiency. There are too many persons in the public sector whose jobs amount to packing up paper clips and watching the clock; and there are too many skilled workers who are not provided with the requisite technology to allow them to be efficient. Those ills must be remedied.Strive for efficiencyOutside of cutting public-sector posts, we do not get the feeling that the modernisation of the public sector is striving to achieve efficiency. We feel that CEOs of departments and agencies must be efficiency czars, ensuring that persons under their watch do not escape with a salary from the taxpayers and giving little in return.There is also the need for the Public Administration and Appropriations Committee of Parliament to demand from permanent secretaries of ministries, a full inventory of the technology needs in the various agencies. And not withstanding the financial bind, the Parliament should seek to impose on these ministries how to allocate scarce resources.At the same time, we urge the Jamaica Productivity Centre to undertake urgent research into the area of public-sector productivity and to recommend to Parliament ways to increase productivity and efficiency by those paid by taxpayers' dollars. This research should be conducted in the shortest possible time, and when tabled in Parliament, the Economy and Production Committee, which has been for the most part idle, should give it detailed consideration.In the interim, however, we hope that Horace Dalley, the minister without portfolio in the finance ministry, who has responsibility for the public service, will give due consideration to the burden on taxpayers' pockets for inefficient service from the public sector. The question must be asked whether it is just for taxpayers to fund long leaves for public-sector workers and whether they should be beneficiaries of certain concessions. We think not.In fact, the argument that they will go to the private sector or migrate does not wash with us. In our view, many of our public-sector workers have no other option than to work within the public sector. Their skill level would not make it through the doors of many private-sector entities, and if they do, they would be kicked out because of a lack of productivity.Therefore, where we continue to have kittens about the magical lowering of public-sector salaries as a percentage of GDP, the time has come for us to face the cold, hard truth. The answer does not simply lie in cutting posts; it also resides in having better qualified and more efficient workers with the necessary tools to enable productivity.thegavel@gleanerjm.comPARLIAMENTARY SCHEDULE Tuesday  9 a.m. Constituency Development Fund Tuesday  2 p.m.Sitting of the House of RepresentativesWednesday 10 a.m.Public Administration &amp; Appropriations Committee Thursday 10 a.m.Senate Committee on National Policy Issues\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7803, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/428ac401db95bff7", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:51:08.910", "title": "Bodies of Postal Service worker, friend found", "occurred_at": "2012-09-17T00:59:44", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120917/lead/lead91.html", "data": "Melissa Davis was \"badly broken\" last evening when the search for her missing father, Barrington Davis, came to a gruesome end.

worst and distracted at best.Many PNP supporters share the sentiment of political analyst Richard 'Dickie' Crawford that \"the PNP appears jaded, lacking impetus and losing direction\".According to Crawford, the PNP appears to be \"a party that is clearly divided over issues of great importance and perhaps methodology and philosophy as well\".Crawford further opined that there is a growing perception that crime and corruption are not being handled properly, as well as a perceived inability of the Government to shore up Jamaica's fragile economy, plus the need for visible dispensation of justice.Crime and corruptionLike Crawford, professor at the University of the West Indies (UWI) Anthony Clayton has twinned crime and corruption as the most pressing issues depressing the Simpson Miller regime.Clayton backed up his arguments with a recently conducted study on the issue.He told The Sunday Gleaner that he calculated the cost of crime and corruption to Jamaica.According to Clayton, if 1972 is taken as the baseline year, the accumulated cost of crime from 1972 to 2010 at 7.1 per cent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) amounts to US$16.7 billion.\"For comparison, Jamaica's public debt at December 2011 was US$18.7 billion, so the accumulated losses due to crime (at 7.1 per cent of GDP) would equal 89 per cent of that debt,\" he pointed out.\"However, it is also necessary to estimate the cumulative impact of lost growth.\"Primarily, as a result of violence, crime and corruption, the economy has stagnated for four decades, with low growth and declining productivity, while other countries have transformed their productive potential, economic growth rates and development prospects,\" he argued.Crawford agreed. \"Apart from the enormous financial costs calculated by Professor Clayton, there is a growing mistrust, apprehension and diminishing public confidence in the ability of the Government and the leadership of the police to deal with the problem,\" Crawford argued.He suggested that crime and corruption continue to affect the psyche of Jamaicans negatively even as the issue of injustice or selective justice remains a big concern.Crawford argued that the ministry of justice's reform programme, to speed up legal procedures and facilitate business and investment, is yet to make a difference, as the unnecessary controversy with and threats against the Office of the Contractor General constitutes another contributory factor.Jamaica vs BarbadosAccording to Clayton, one way to estimate this loss is to compare Jamaica with Barbados, a smaller country with few natural resources.\"If Jamaica's rate of productivity growth had kept pace with that of Barbados, then Jamaica today would be almost three times more productive and wealthier than it is now, and the quality of life would have been correspondingly transformed,\" he proffered.\"Another way to estimate this loss is to project forward from the rate of growth before Jamaica's descent into violence, when Jamaica's economic growth rate collapsed from nearly five per cent to just over one per cent.\"If Jamaica had not lapsed into violence in the early 1970s, and the growth rate of the 1960s had continued, then today the economy would be almost 10 times larger than it is now,\" argued Clayton.Crawford and financial analyst Ralston Hyman share the view that Simpson Miller needs to address the issue of the ailing economy that is pressured by an overwhelming debt burden.\"The (economic) situation is becoming more acute each day as the proposed conditions of the Government/IMF programme seem incapable of remedying the enormous difficulties in the economy,\" argued Crawford.\"The PNP must address the deterioration in the economy, characterised by the increase in unemployment to 14.3 per cent,\" said Hyman.He contended that the deterioration in the external accounts, manifested in the increasing trade and current account deficits of US$4.3 billion and US$2.1 billion, respectively, last year.Hyman stressed that Simpson Miller must also speak to the decline in the net international reserves to US$1.48 billion as at the end of August this year, from US$2.6 billion in July of last year.The protracted delay in securing an IMF agreement and a devaluing dollar are also sources of concern for Hyman.He added, \"the PNP must also address the loss of confidence caused by the delays in securing an IMF agreement and the continuous slide in the value of the Jamaican currency\".Hyman wants the Simpson Miller administration to outline a strategy, including exporting more and importing less in order to drive sustainable growth and employment, as well as to reduce the rising levels of poverty.\n\n", "tags":

Senior Staff Reporter\"FISCAL TARGETS cannot eat and people cannot sleep on balance sheet.\"That was the bold declaration from People's National Party (PNP) President Portia Simpson Miller at a campaign meeting in Mandeville, Manchester, on the eve of last December's general election.Throughout the campaign, Simpson Miller labelled the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) administration, which then formed the Government, as being uncaring and wicked.She also said it was focusing so much on attempting to balance the books at the expense of people's lives.Now, eight months after taking the reins as prime minister, Simpson Miller will today address party supporters at the PNP's 74th annual conference at the National Arena.Fitz Jackson, a solid Comrade, has conceded that the party has not been able to deliver on the hope that the people were promised, but said this is due mainly to a ramshackle economy which it inherited.\"There is some amount of disappointment out there that their situation has not been made better up to now. They are not angry at us. They are disappointed that their situation has not improved, but they remain more hopeful and I hear that expressed a lot,\" Jackson told The Sunday Gleaner.The PNP romped to power with a massive 42-21 seat win over the JLP in the December 29 general election.The party, with its 'People Power' slogan, had convinced the majority of voters that things were heading in the wrong direction under the JLP and that the PNP was their best choice.By March, the PNP secured a resounding 2:1 victory in local government elections, underscoring the confidence of the people that it was the party to manage the affairs of the country.Jackson, who represents South St Catherine, said the margin of victory was \"a demonstration of greater hope that things will be better for them under the leadership of the People's National Party\".Dr Dayton Campbell, who was among the new members of parliament elected last December, said that hope is being kept alive amid the turbulence.\"The expectations are high as persons are finding it extremely difficult to meet their daily needs,\" said Campbell.He told The Sunday Gleaner that in North West St Ann, the constituency he represents, the people have not lost faith in the PNP administration.While conceding that some of the high expectations have not been met, Campbell argued that leadership is important in straddling expectations and reality.CREATE OPPORTUNITIES\"We as politicians have to be sensitive to the needs of our people and be creative in seeing how best we can create opportunities to aid in alleviating the challenges being experienced,\" said Campbell.\"I have done 958 back-to-school medical checks free of charge; given out 1,500 book vouchers for back to school; assisted more than 500 farmers with chicken, chicken feed, seeds, fertiliser, tools, etc. So I understand their plight as I, too, know exactly what it's like to have little or nothing to survive on,\" the first-time MP said.Campbell said he does not think the PNP made any promises on the campaign trail that would cause the party now to be in a pickle with its supporters.Instead, Campbell said the expectations for the party to bring salvation to a failing land may be misplaced.\"I think people tend to forget most of the time that it has only been eight months since assuming the government,\" said Campbell.He argued that the party has already started to deliver on some key promises, among them the Jamaica Emergency Employment Programme (JEEP).The JEEP secretariat this month said the first phase exceeded its projection of 5,000 persons employed. It said more than 15,000 persons have been employed in JEEP Phase I.Phase II of JEEP is scheduled to begin this month and is expected to employ more than 35,000 persons, the secretariat said.In the meantime, Jackson argued that it is easy for people to get carried away during election campaigns, thinking that milk and honey will flow from having their candidates elected.\"The exuberance in an election, even when you warn people they still have their expectations. And they have the confidence in the Government that they would make things better for them,\" Jackson said.On the campaign trail, Simpson Miller said, \"My campaign will promise nothing that we are not certain we can deliver.\" She also told Jamaicans that she is aware of their plight and said \"help is on the way.\"She, however, promised to use JEEP to \"divide the Jamaica Labour Party river so that the people can pass freely into a land of prosperity development and growth\".Eight months since taking power, the JEEP has rolled out, but poverty levels remain high and economic growth appears an abstract term.daraine.luton@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7811, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/56b9f419c914d43f", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:51:12.728", "title": "Damion on the right path - Patrick Roberts backs under-pressure first-time MP's education push", "occurred_at": "2012-09-17T00:59:44", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120916/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Arthur Hall, Senior News EditorOutspoken People's National Party (PNP) Councillor Patrick Roberts has come out in support of his political colleague Damion Crawford, who is under pressure in East Rural St Andrew over the spending of State funds.Roberts has also chided fellow politicians on both sides of the political divide, who he described as lazy, going to the people only when they want votes.\"Some politicians just too lazy and they are not with the people and don't know the people,\" Roberts told The Sunday Gleaner.\"What Damion Crawford is doing, what Omar Davies is doing, and what I'm doing \u0085 is the way forward and the only alternative out of crime and violence right now,\" Roberts said while donating textbooks worth more than $1.7 million to students in the West Central St Andrew constituency.\"The difference between me and Damion Crawford \u0085 is that I'm not using State funds.

But his last published fiction during his lifetime was the 1933 novel Banana Bottom.The just-discovered manuscript, Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem, was discovered in a previously untouched university archive and offers an unusual window on the ideas and events (like Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia) that animated Harlem on the cusp of World War II.A major discoveryThe two scholars have received permission from the McKay estate to publish the novel, a satire set in 1936, with an introduction about how it was found and its provenance verified.\"This is a major discovery,\" said Henry Louis Gates Jr, the Harvard University scholar, who was one of three experts called upon to examine the novel and supporting research. \"It dramatically expands the canon of novels written by Harlem Renaissance writers and, obviously, novels by Claude McKay.\"More important, because it was written in the second half of the Harlem Renaissance, it shows that the renaissance continued to be vibrant and creative and turned its focus to international issues - in this case the tensions between Communists, on the one hand, and black nationalists, on the other, for the hearts and minds of black Americans,\" said Gates, the director of the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research at Harvard.This literary detective story began in the summer of 2009, when Jean-Christophe Cloutier, a doctoral candidate in English and comparative literature, was working as an intern in the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Columbia.He was going through more than 50 boxes of materials belonging to Samuel Roth, a kind of literary pariah who died in 1974 and is best known for being the appellant in a famous obscenity case in the 1950s.Roth is also known for publishing work without permission, including excerpts from James Joyce's Ulysses and editions of Lady Chatterley's Lover by D. H. Lawrence. Roth attended Columbia and his family donated his collection to the university.No one knew of a connection between Roth and McKay, Cloutier said, as he came upon the roughly 300-page double-spaced manuscript, bound between cardboard-like covers bearing the novel's title and McKay's name.He also found two letters from McKay to Roth about possibly ghostwriting a novel to be called Descent Into Harlem, about an Italian immigrant who settles in Harlem.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7813, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/656e5aa719b8afa4", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:51:13.642", "title": "Best Care boost from Sagicor", "occurred_at": "2012-09-17T00:59:44", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120916/lead/lead7.html", "data": "The Corporate Area-based Best Care Foundation has received a donation of $340,000 to help in refurbishing its home.Sagicor team members yesterday handed over the money which was raised through the annual Sagicor Motivational Seminar (SMS) which is slated for later this month.Sagicor team members have also volunteered their time and effort to work at the Best Care Foundation to give the dining room and kitchen at the institution a facelift.\"Sagicor lends support to entities in need all year round; but the SMS period is one which facilitates team members coming together and giving of themselves,\"said Barrington Groves, brand manager for Sagicor\"The energy of Sagicor team members is typically that of a positive nature and each year when there is extra emphasis placed on helping a charity, there is a twinkle in everyone's eyes,\" added Marcia Richards, chairman of the Sagicor planning committee.School supplies drive The company also initiated a clothing and school supplies drive among its employees and solicited help from Lasco and other corporate companies which have committed to donating a large quantity of toiletries and other pertinent supplies to the foundation.The Best Care Foundation is a privately run institution which depends heavily on donations from the private sector.The home was established in 1976 and caters to mentally challenged children and young adults.It provides residential accommodation; a therapeutic environment through the dispensation of nursing, dental and medical care; special educational opportunities, social interaction and sporting activities.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7814, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5752605e33432d88", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:51:14.070", "title": "Keep those stations open - Ellington", "occurred_at": "2012-09-17T00:59:44", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120916/lead/lead8.html", "data": "Police Commissioner Owen Ellington has reiterated that all police stations should be open to the public 24 hours each day.Pointing to a recent Sunday Gleaner probe centred on the delivery of services during the nights at police stations in Kingston and St Andrew, Manchester, and St James, Ellington applauded the men and women who were on duty when the investigative team visited.\"Reporters from the newspaper visited several stations and on each occasion they were able to access the services we deliver without any undue wait, even in circumstances where station entrance doors were closed,\" noted Ellington in the Force Orders published last Friday.\"The results from this investigative foray put to rest speculations that stations are closed at nights while personnel sleep and no policing services are being offered,\" added Ellington.RISK ASSESSMENTHe noted that based on the location of some police stations and the attendant risk assessment, they may close their front entrance doors where guard rooms are located.\"The closing of entrance doors does not mean we should lose our alertness.

It is something that you can manage but you pay a price,\" added Bunting.According to Bunting, as general secretary, he leads a secretariat that relies less and less on the officers of the party, who have to carry out the work of the Government.This is to address the regular problem for political parties in the region where the party's structure and organisation struggles while it forms the Government.According to Bunting, for the past three or so years, the PNP has been transitioning into an entity that relies more on the regional bodies to do the political organising.\"It was something that was resisted initially because we used to have regional organisers employed to the secretariat, but truthfully, we just could not afford it. So we put the responsibility down for the organising of the constituencies and the divisions to the regional organisations.\"We put a lot more responsibility on the shoulders of the regional chairmen and their management teams \u0085 .

But foreign policy leaped to the forefront in recent days when protesters attacked United States diplomats and missions in the Middle East, and it's unclear when it will recede.Criticisms of Romney's quick-draw response to the protests underscored both his foreign policy vulnerabilities and the difficulty in knocking off an incumbent, especially one who remains relatively well-liked despite a struggling economy. Obama used the trappings of the presidency to full advantage. He led sombre events honouring the four US officials killed in Libya. He also needled his challenger by saying that Romney \"seems to have a tendency to shoot first and aim later\".ROMNEY RISKING RECOVERYAs unrest abroad continues, Obama is launching an aggressive effort to convince voters in the most competitive states - Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, and Virginia - that his economic policies are working and that Romney is risking the nation's recovery with a plan that caters to multimillionaires over the middle class.\"They want to go back to the same old policies that got us in trouble in the first place,\" former President Bill Clinton is shown saying in a 60-second TV ad.Romney is trying to get back to the economy, his strength, even as a new national survey by The New York Times and CBS News finds that he has lost his long-standing edge on the question of whom voters view as most likely to restore the economy and create jobs.Voters are feeling slightly more optimistic that the president's policies are helping. Still, that poll and others found the race narrowly divided.\"Beating an incumbent is never easy,\" Romney told ABC last Friday.He dismissed polls that show Obama ahead. \"I'm doing well ... and this is a campaign which I think will come into focus as the debates occur.\"FRUSTRATION SHOWSFrustration is showing in some GOP circles because Romney has failed to move ahead of Obama despite months of highlighting the nation's high jobless rate and the millions of dollars spent pushing an economic message on TV.Romney allies are urging him to find a message that will persuade disillusioned voters to give him a chance. They reject the notion that Romney is careening from topic to topic, despite recent emphases on Medicare and international leadership.Diverse advice is pouring into Romney's camp: Paint Obama as a weak leader at home and abroad; shift the focus firmly back to the economy; fire up the conservative base; concentrate on the relatively small number of undecided voters.Some of Romney's associates, including his running mate, say personality, not policy, may hold the key to reassuring wary voters.\"I'm not the only one who has told Mitt that maybe he needs to talk more about himself and his life,\" Paul Ryan, the GOP's vice-presidential nominee, told conservative activists last Friday.The buttoned-down Romney has relatively little time to show a warmer, more assuring side to voters. Three presidential debates in October may offer his best chance.In the race to reach 270 electoral votes for victory, polls suggest Obama holds slight edges in the crucial states of Ohio, Florida, Virginia and New Hampshire.And internal polling by both campaigns shows close races in Colorado, Iowa and Nevada. Both sides agree that Romney is doing better in North Carolina, which Obama narrowly carried in 2008.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7817, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6545337577ece80e", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:51:20.451", "title": "Sex text scrapped - Ministry pulls controversial book from high schools", "occurred_at": "2012-09-17T00:59:44", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120915/lead/lead1.html", "data": "Anastasia Cunningham, News Coordinator\"ARE THESE people insane?\" one father asked The Gleaner yesterday. \"My son just started high school and this is supposed to be his introduction?\"\"My child is not ready for this, when he's ready, I will teach him,\" expressed one mother.Despite the fact that the Ministry of Education had recalled the health and family life education  curriculum from high schools, several parents are still quite upset and demanding to know how the text was approved in the first place.The Sexuality and Sexual Health: Personal Risk and Assessment Checklist segment of the third edition of the curriculum geared at grades seven to nine was what caused the uproar.Contentious QuestionsAmong the questions posed to students were: Have you ever had sexual intercourse? Have you ever had anal sex without a condom? What caused you to be a heterosexual? When and how did you first discover you were heterosexual? If you have never slept with a member of your own sex, is it possible you might be gay if you tried it? Why do heterosexuals seduce others into their lifestyle?The book also instructed students to perform a number of exercises to better understand their sexuality.Yesterday, Minister of Education Ronald Thwaites ordered the curriculum pulled, saying some of the material was \"inappropriate\".\"I have been made aware of widespread public concern about certain sections of the health and family life education programme curriculum used in Jamaican schools. There is strong objection to some of the questions on sexual behaviour and the commentary on heterosexuality/homosexuality,\" the minister said.\"I consider sections of the material inappropriate for any age and certainly for the grade seven and eight students for which it is designed.\"He added, \"I have instructed that the material be withdrawn from all schools and rewritten then redistributed so as to prevent disruption of the health and family life education instruction.\"PARENTS WANT INPUTHowever, at least one parent is demanding that the minister get the approval of the parents before the curriculum is reintroduced.\"The minister needs to make sure we know what is in that book before he sends it back out to be taught to my child. In fact, he needs to tell us how this material was approved in the first place.

In thanking the foundation for these gifts, Senior Medical Officer Dr Hopeton Falconer said there was great need for the equipment as it would enable medical personnel to better treat and monitor patients with various types of heart problems.Falconer said that special training to use the machines was required and that he was very thankful and grateful that MANWELL had stepped forward and donated funds that would allow additional nurses and doctors to participate in the special training programmes.Doctors and nurses, who benefited from the weekend courses, were exposed to the Advanced Cardiac Life Support, which trains medical personnel to resuscitate patients who have had a cardiac arrest, as well as in the interpretation of electrocardiograms in an emergency setting. MANWELL's funds will also be used for training more nurses required for the monitoring of cardiac patients on the wards.In explaining the purpose of the sigmoidoscope that was presented to the Percy Junor Hospital, Falconer said that the instrument would enable doctors to examine the lower part of the large intestine from the rectum to the sigmoid colon for detection of certain pathologies such as polyps (small lumps), as well as other tumours that might be cancerous.GRATEFUL FOR HELPChief executive officer of the Mandeville Regional Hospital, Alwyn Miller, led guests on a tour of the hospital where a treatment centre has been established to care specifically for patients suffering heart attacks and other acute cardiac events. He thanked MANWELL for making the centre a reality.CEO of the Percy Junor Hospital, Earl McLaughlin, in expressing appreciation for the Sigmoidoscope, noted that the doctors would now be able to make more accurate diagnoses of patients who might present with symptoms that could represent a variety of diseases, which might be malignant.In her her remarks, MANWELL chairman, Alicia James, disclosed that since its inception in 2003, the foundation had donated over $6.5 million in equipment, cash, and kind to hospitals, and other health facilities throughout Manchester. To be able to afford donations, the foundation stages an annual fund-raising event called 'Let's Eat and Dance'. This year, it will be held at the Ingleside Wellness Centre (formerly Badminton Club) on Saturday, November 3. Tickets are available from the directors.The foundation also gives back to the community as it hosts an annual free health fair which, this year, will be held on the Mandeville Greens today. All major health tests will be available, along with the giving away of many prizes and surprises.The directors of the Manchester Wellness Foundation are Chairman Alicia James, Carolgene Williams, Danny Lewis, Myrna Bailey, Fay Heaven, Valerie Dixon, Dr Carol Burrell, Janice Henry, Herschell Ismail, Diana McIntyre-Pike, and Jean Caesar-Brown.

Another purpose of the trip was to promote cooperation between respective institutions in South Africa (universities and colleges), which in the future could lead to more exchanges between staff and students from both sides.Nzimande noted that the South African delegation was visiting Jamaica during its 50th anniversary of Independence, which has been 50 years of solidarity with the many struggles in his homeland.\"This visit is the first for me and my delegation.

Have you ever had anal sex without a condom? What caused you to be a heterosexual? When and how did you first discover you were heterosexual? If you have never slept with a member of your own sex, is it possible you might be gay if you tried it?

Regrettably, many made the ultimate sacrifice while being members of the British military fighting the Nazis during the wars (WWI, 1914-1918; WWII, 1934-1945). Those who made it home were not forgotten. In the 1950s, Curphey Home was established under the direction of the Jamaican Legion to nurture the needs of our war veterans, especially in their senior years.Sitting on 54 acres of land in south Manchester, six miles to the south of Mandeville, it remains the place of comfort for 13 former soldiers, including one female, who served Jamaica with distinction. Among the group is 90-year-old John Lloyd Wint, and a former member of the Royal Air Force. The brother of Jamaica's first Olympic gold medallist, Arthur Wint, he remains mentally sharp and is in good health. When The Gleaner visited the home, he was busy having lunch while watching television. He, however, interrupted his lunch to offer his welcome.CHALLENGESWhile the care being given to the soldiers is exceptional and the facility is immaculately clean, it still faces many challenges.Superintendent Irwin, who is in charge of Curphey Home, said the main problem results from a lack of piped water, and the closing down of the mining company, Alpart, which used to assist the home with the commodity. Frequent power cuts by the Jamaica Public Service Company are also causing safety concerns and discomfort for the residents.Matron Teisha Staple-Johnson indicated that a working standby generator would be a welcome addition to the facility.Aware of the contributions of these and other Jamaicans - who fought to keep Jamaica, as well as British, American, French and several other country's citizens from Nazi domination - custos of Manchester, Sally Porteous, is spearheading a drive to assist Curphey Home to continue to deliver quality care to these former soldiers. A concert to raise funds will be staged, in association with the Jamaica Regiment Band,  tomorrow at deCarteret College in Mandeville.The custos told The Gleaner: \"Freedom is priceless, and at no time should it be treated lightly, or there may come a day when future generations will have to fight for it all over again, as these former soldiers did.\"rural@gleanerjm.com \n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7829, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9aad60de7fe3bcc3", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:56:20.429", "title": "Gov't steps in to stem dengue spread", "occurred_at": "2012-09-15T03:49:21", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120914/lead/lead4.html", "data": "Nadisha Hunter, Staff ReporterThe Ministry of Health is to intensify its mosquito control programme in all parishes in wake of an increase in the number of reported cases of dengue fever in the island.Director of the Health Promotion and Protection Unit in the Ministry of Health, Dr Kevin Harvey, said yesterday that the ministry was looking at some of the steps required to diminish the mosquito population within the short term.Harvey said so far there have been 507 reports of the disease, of which 180 cases have been confirmed by laboratory tests.He signalled that he was not ruling out that the situation could reach an outbreak, with the increase in the number of reports.\"We could have an outbreak.

It exists in all parishes, in all communities, it is more prevalent in densely populated areas such as in town centres,\" he explained.Harvey further stated: \"The Aedes aegypti mosquito lives in communities, in households, in flowerpots, in tyres, in drums that we use to store water and, therefore, in order to prevent dengue, we have to prevent the breeding of the mosquito by cleaning up these breeding sites.\"nadisha.hunter@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7830, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5aaccec8674b0e48", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:56:20.928", "title": "AJ Nicholson leaves for Cuba tomorrow", "occurred_at": "2012-09-15T03:49:21", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120914/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade A.J.

As a result, they were unable to convene constituency conferences.The conflict-ridden East Rural St Andrew is among several delinquent constituencies.Robinson said while he was unable to state the specific number of delegates and constituencies affected, \"There are quite a few who are what we term 'unrecognised constituencies,' which place them in the category of not being able to host an annual (constituency) conference.\"He added: \"So their status continues to be provisional at this point in time.\"He said as there would be two categories of persons attending the private session of the conference.\"One set comprises duly paid-up members elected by the groups to represent them, and then we have a provision for observer status, where we allow those persons who are in a group that is in abeyance to be observers so their status continues to be provisional at this point in time.\"NO ELECTIONSFortunately for the delegates, there will be no need for votes to be cast on Saturday as PNP President Portia Simpson Miller and all four incumbent vice-presidents - Noel Arscott, Dr Fenton Ferguson, Derrick Kellier and Angela Brown Burke - will be returned unopposed.At last month's meetings of the six RECs, a range of discrepancies were brought to the attention of the PNP Secretariat, revealing that some high-profile stalwarts were not paid-up members of a duly constituted group. This, in effect, disqualified them from being official members of the party.In the meantime, PNP General Secretary Peter Bunting said since he assumed the position in 2008, the PNP Secretariat has moved to tidy the group system, which was a source of contention in the lead-up to the 2006 presidential election.In this regard, he said amendments were made to the PNP's constitution to, among others things, cap the number of groups that any constituency can have.

Average life expectancy, which was approximately 65 years in 1962, has been extended to over 75 years; equivalent to First-World standards. Communicable diseases such as polio, diphtheria, and the like, have been eliminated.Infant mortality has been sharply reduced from 50 per thousand to 17. Similarly, in respect of educational opportunity, there has been a steady expansion. Post-primary education, which prior to 1962 was confined largely to the planter and merchant elite, and to a few aspiring elements of an emergent black middle class, was to be opened up by a succession of policy initiatives beginning with the implementation of the Common Entrance Examination in 1957.The net effect was that secondary school enrolment (ages 12-18) moved from 8.7 per cent of students in the cohort in 1962 to 78.2 per cent currently. The pattern has been similar with respect to tertiary education, with .5 per cent or 1,783 students of the relevant cohorts enrolled in 1966 for post-secondary education as compared to current where 68,993 students are enrolled in tertiary institutions, which is over 33.1 per cent of the cohort. Of this amount, 19 per cent are enrolled in 'traditional' universities (UWI, UTech, etc), others are matriculated in community colleges, etc.The sphere of politics also has been one in which steady progress has been experienced. The essential institutional framework of liberal democracy has been sustained and, indeed, deepened. In Jamaica, governments have been regularly removed by electoral means. Rights to free expression of opinion and free association have been enthusiastically and, at times, rambunctiously exercised; while the Parliament has evolved an increasingly elaborate and effective system of committees and other procedures, which have, in essence, provided for the continuous engagement of the opposition party and civil society representatives in the overall process of governance. Equally, note should be taken of the expanded role of 'independent' commissions of Parliament such as the Electoral Commission or the contractor general, which have acted substantially as restraints on the executive authority.Bolstered by stability and democracy at home, the country has been able to pursue a wide-ranging and activist foreign policy. In the 50 years since Independence, passive 'pro-Westernism' has been supplanted by a vigorously exercised foreign policy organised around Jamaica's national interest in promoting regional integration and global development. While maintaining traditional relationships and attachments, Jamaica has broadened its representation and its relationships to include countries in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and has maintained an active engagement in the United Nations system and other councils advancing the agenda of developing countries.The other side of the story Yet, despite all these very palpable gains, Jamaican society still reflects to a considerable extent the scars inherited from its pre-Independence colonial history. For one thing, poverty and income inequality abound. Despite long-term reduction in the incidence of poverty, the most recent measurements suggest that one-fifth of the population subsists below the poverty line and that Jamaica has one of the most unequal distributions of income in the region. Even more, circumstances predisposing towards the inter-generational transfer of poverty seem particularly durable.Among the indicators of this persistence of poverty is the high levels of teenage pregnancies, particularly among the poorest segments of the population and the high number of children born to single parents, which in turn points to the fragility of family structures, a feature of Jamaican society which has deep roots in our plantation society experience.The long-term persistence of poverty and its socio-cultural supports are further exacerbated by the persistence of a two-tiered educational system offering unequal opportunities, despite prolonged efforts by successive political administrations to extend the scope of educational access and opportunity.Today, despite the improvements in some newer schools, the educational system remains bifurcated with the so-called traditional high-schools achieving high-quality examination results as compared with newer non-traditional high schools where more than 75 per cent of the students fail to achieve the necessary passes in the basic subjects of mathematics and English.It is also true that a major explanation of the long-term persistence of poverty lies in Jamaica's failure to maintain high rates of economic growth, even after an initially strong performance in the early post-Independence years when the economy grew by more than five per cent per annum, growth slowed from the 1970s onwards such that average growth for the entire post-Independence period has been less than two per cent, with per capita incomes hardly changing.In the face of external shocks sparked first of all by sharply rising oil prices from 1973 onwards, the predominant consequence has been a steady rise in public debt as political authorities sought to sustain social gains with borrowed funds. Despite an average growth rate of less than one per cent since 1973, public debt has increased by more than 700 per cent.Policy choices, which emphasised income redistribution and which institutionalised sectoral imbalances by means of an inefficiently administered system of incentives and waivers, which created major distortions and imbalances in investment choices.Over time, too, the fiscal crisis of the state worsened as the tax base has shrunk and the burden of taxation has fallen disproportionately on the pay-as-you-earn workers. The failures of administration and corruption have further fuelled an endemic culture of tax evasion and avoidance, generating in its wake a growing cynicism about politics and public administration.A way forwardJamaica is now at the point where the debt is unsustainable. With a debt to GDP ratio of approximately 130 per cent, the country risks isolation from global capital markets and is confronted by the prospect of a sharp reversal of such social gains as have been made as an increasingly large share of revenues is spent on debt service; rather than on capital investments or social expenditures necessary to sustain programmes for the Jamaican people.The fundamental challenge then, as we embark on the next phase of our journey as an independent state, is to lay the foundations of a new economic architecture for Jamaica. The critical elements of this new architecture have been identified and are widely being discussed. They include the need to sharply reduce the burden of public debt, which will, if done resolutely and efficiently, create room for the possibility in the medium term of more sustained social investments and capital expenditure.In turn, debt reduction will require substantial and sustained fiscal reforms, including but not limited to tax reforms aimed at broadening the base of taxpayers and reducing rates while ensuring simplicity, efficiency and basic fairness to the overall tax system. Also, fundamentally important is the need to strengthen compliance and the enforcement capacity of the tax administration.Public-sector transformation to reduce operating costs, while ensuring greater efficiencies and more competitive remuneration for public-sector employers over the medium term is also an indispensable element in the new fiscal environment which must be built.All the fiscal measures will not suffice, however, unless we also focus policy and effort on addressing those factors which diminish the competitiveness of the productive sector. Central to this must be measures to create a more enabling environment for business operations. These could include, for example, shortening the time and complexity involved in company registration; securing development approvals, registering mortgages, effecting land transfers and the like. It should mean, for example, support by way of tax credits for worker training and research and development activities.Quite apart from the focus on economic policy measures designed to achieve fiscal balance and improve factory productivity, overcoming the historical legacies of poverty and inequality will require other measures. Prime among those has to be the elimination of the inequalities in performance that are embedded in the educational system.Effective diagnosis as to the critical factors which underpin and reinforce the differentials in performance between the traditional and non-traditional high schools still remains to be done. It is apparent, nevertheless, that the traditional high schools have benefited from strong community supports - from churches and alumni, which in turn provide relative autonomy for school administrators vis-\u00e0-vis government bureaucracy.Simultaneously, these wider community interests help enforce accountability standards on the school leadership.In summary, the tasks for the first decade of the next 50 years seem easily defined. The central objective is the elimination of poverty through wealth creation. The main focus of policy should be on fiscal management, investment facilitation and educational reform. To say this is not to devalue or remove from consideration those other areas of policy intervention necessary to reinforce the main effort. Justice reform, public-sector efficiency reforms, and improvements in the quality of governance will continue to be of importance as policy objectives in the near term.Simply identifying the challenges, however, will not guarantee our success in surmounting them. That task, above all else, will require exemplary leadership in all spheres of national life to identify vital priorities and goals and to mobilise the collective will for their attainment.Overall, the central challenge for the next 50 years must be to correct the inherited scars of social inequality which impede the prospects of Caribbean development.\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7848, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0b5ae1d08f2a83e1", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:56:32.748", "title": "100 years of Calabar High School (part 2)", "occurred_at": "2012-09-13T04:01:02", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120913/lead/lead91.html", "data": "Arnold Bertram, ContributorFROM ITS inception, Calabar High School began providing a critical vehicle for the development of an intelligentsia with an internationalist perspective and the capacity for nation building. In 1912, there were only 593 boys enrolled in the high schools islandwide.The first boy to enrol at Calabar was Alfred McDonald, the son of a Baptist minister who was stationed in Port Limon, Costa Rica, who arrived two weeks early and stayed with the headmaster.Among the 29 students who enrolled on the first Monday of the school year were 13 sons of Baptist ministers, including Stewart Gordon-Somers, son of the Rev Thomas Gordon-Somers; Willy Turner, son of Rev George Turner of Croft's Hill; and the Phillips brothers, Edward and Lester.Edward's son Allan followed in his footsteps to Calabar in 1933, and his grandson Andrew became the third generation to wear Calabar colours when he arrived in 1956. During these first eight years the stream of Baptist sons to Calabar continued to flow. In 1916, Vernon Arnett, the grandson of the Rev William Webb, arrived, and the following year Frank Gordon-Somers joined his elder brother Stewart. By 1920, Ivan Eccleston, Burchell Phillips, Henry and Chester Touzalin would be counted among the other sons of Baptist ministers enrolled at Calabar.Ministers of other denominations also seized the opportunity for affordable secondary education for their sons. The Presbyterians led the way with the Reverend W.A. Graham of The Scots Kirk whose two elder sons, W.A. and G.M. Graham, were in the first batch of students. A third son, Cyril Milroy, joined his brothers in 1916. That same year a second Presbyterian family, the Websters, also chose Calabar for the first three of their four sons - Carl, Olney and George. The fourth son, William, followed in 1920. Another Presbyterian minister, Thomas Henry Grant, also sent his son, Thomas Jr, to Calabar.The Methodists were not to be left out and in 1914 Philip Sherlock, the first son of the Methodist minister Terrence Manderson Sherlock, was registered at Calabar. By 1920, his three brothers - Frank, Hugh and Arthur - were also in Calabar uniform. The Moravians were not far behind the Methodists as K.D. Carnegie, the elder son of the Moravian minister the Reverend James Carnegie, was enrolled in 1915, and his younger brother, Alfred, followed shortly after.In addition to the sons of nonconformist clergymen, other fixed-income earners, particularly teachers and civil servants, seized the opportunity for affordable education that the Baptists provided at Calabar. These included the parents of Aldwyn Stephenson (St James), Vernon Anderson (St Mary), Eric Patterson (St Catherine), A.H. Brooks (Manchester), and E. Serrant (Clarendon), Vincent Brissett (Trelawny), Harold Darby (St Ann) and O.T. Fairclough (Westmoreland) who enrolled their sons during this period.Very few, if any, of these parents earning fixed income owned motor cars. Boarding fees were a drain on the family income. Their sons arrived each term by bus or train and walked up to Studley Park Road, suitcases in hand. Others from rural parishes found it more economical to have their sons stay with relatives in the city and walk to school each day. They all arrived with a sense of mission, conscious of their role as pioneers and makers of history. They knew only too well the extent of the family investment in their education and that only hard work and success could repay their parents' effort.While Calabar was identified with the 'class on the rise', the school welcomed all social classes. Some of its earliest students like James Hylton (St Catherine), Donald Robertson (St James), Herbert Cox and H.D. Hopwood (St Ann) were from landed families.A few like Isaac Aarons (St James), whose family were the owners of the Montego Bay Ice Company Ltd, and Ivan Hendriks, whose father had a furniture-making establishment in Kingston, were from the emerging business class. The Webster boys were from a ship-owning family in Grand Cayman who came to Jamaica in 1916 and established a network of commercial enterprises. The multiracial student body broadened the social base of the school, and the deliberate inculcation of Christian values contributed to the development of friendships across colour and class lines.Overseas students From the school's inception, overseas students became a part of the student body and Calabar soon began receiving requests for school places from the missions established by the Jamaica Baptist Missionary Society in West Africa, Haiti, Cuba, Costa Rica, Panama, Cayman and Turks &amp; Caicos Islands. During the first eight years while the school's population grew from 29 to 90 boys, the pattern of enrolment remained consistent.Calabar students welcomed the religious environment which dominated the school campus. For many it was an extension of home where morning devotion and involvement in the local church was a way of life. The school's focus on the inculcation of Christian values was strengthened by the building of a school chapel in 1914. Students at the Theological College joined students for evening services and the entire campus developed a close relationship with the Jones Town Baptist Church.The annual fees were provisionally established at \u00a38 for day boys and \u00a330 for boarders. Parents were asked to deposit an extra \u00a31 for books and the school provided holiday accommodation for external students. The school, however, extended various levels of subsidy not only to Baptist ministers, but to other ministers of religion, teachers and parents with more than one boy at the school. School fees accounted for only 60 per cent of the school's income and the Government grant contributed another seven per cent. The commitment of the Baptists to providing affordable secondary education was reflected in the fact that it was the church membership that made up the deficit from voluntary contributions.Headmaster Price brought to the job his pioneering spirit, which together with his capacity to persevere against the odds and to identify with the aspirations of African-Jamaicans made him ideal for the challenges which Calabar posed in the early years. Davis turned out to be the Mister 'Fixit' that the fledgling institution desperately needed. He found a solution for every problem. By the end of the first term Price was describing him as a man who \"talks to himself in Hebrew and dreams in Syriac ... a colleague who can diagnose and cure the diseases of motor cars, and trace a recalcitrant half-penny through pages of a balance sheet. He can plan a house, estimate its cost within three farthings and then erect it with his own hands ... He devises most intricate timetables for the school and college, puts himself down for every period, is always ready to advise a minister who calls on him or to drive a hundred miles to see his difficulty on the spot.\"The staff was predominantly British and the first Jamaican teacher recruited was Rev R.A.L. Knight, MA, BD, who was born in Four Paths, Clarendon, in 1890, and attended Calabar Elementary School, Wolmer's and Jamaica College. He gained a scholarship to McMasters University in Canada, where he successfully completed a Bachelor's in Divinity and an MA. In 1914, he became the first Jamaican to join the staff at Calabar.The school quickly developed an intellectually stimulating environment. Philip Sherlock, who graduated in 1920, later reflected on the impact of Ernest Price's \"imaginative and stimulating approach particularly in the teaching of literature, and his way of always relating the subject to a wider background (which he found) both amazing and magnetic\". He also remembered the experience of being exposed to the distinguished Oxonian, Elliott Dodds, who taught him history. Dodds (1889-1977) was a graduate of Oxford University, a journalist, a deacon in the Congregationalist Church and a leader of the Liberal Party in Britain. While on a visit to Jamaica, he accepted the invitation of Rev David Davis to teach history at the school. His most lasting contribution was his adaptation of Johnathon Strong's Like an Ancient River Flowing, which became the school song.After Dodds left Calabar, David Davis filled the gap even more completely as the school's resident intellectual and leader of liberal thought. In addition to Philip Sherlock, three other Calabar boys of the period who were clearly influenced by both Davis and Dodds were Roger Mais, Vernon Arnett and O.T. Fairclough. All four would figure prominently in Jamaica's political development.Use of the cane Both Price and Davies placed great importance on the use of the cane to maintain discipline and exert authority. There was hardly a perpetrator of indiscipline who they did not consider redeemable by the consistent application of generous doses of caning. The story of Bob Henry's transfer from Cornwall to Calabar in 1929 confirms the importance that Price and other headmasters of his time attached to caning.According to Henry, at the end of 1928, his headmaster advised his father to make other arrangements for the completion of his son's high school education. The boy had taxed to the utmost the resources of patience and forgiveness of the staff, and would no longer be accepted as a student at Cornwall. His father used his credentials as a devout Baptist to secure a transfer for him to Calabar. The headmaster also agreed to give him a letter of introduction, which he went to collect on the appointed day.To his dismay the headmaster, no doubt reflecting on his misdemeanours over the years, some of which may have escaped punishment, caned him before giving him the letter. The following week he presented himself at Calabar for an entry interview with Headmaster Price. Henry remembers Price groaning in apparent pain as he read the letter. Then to his surprise he saw Price take out his cane and sternly instructed him to 'bend over'. Many strokes later his admission to Calabar was complete. Price's methods did wonders for Bob Henry. He represented the school in football and after graduating became a successful businessman, and a very popular and colourful custos of St James.Calabar quickly became an international campus with a well-deserved reputation for academic proficiency and character building, demonstrating its capacity to realise the vision of its founders by providing a thoroughly modern education in a religious environment to equip young men to excel in their chosen vocation, whether in Jamaica or abroad.\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7849, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/677ad8a36c10d79b", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:56:33.644", "title": "Unplanned housing hampering water distribution - Bartlett", "occurred_at": "2012-09-13T04:01:02", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120913/lead/lead92.html", "data": "Christopher Thomas, Gleaner WriterWESTERN BUREAU:EAST CENTRAL St James Member of Parliament (MP) Edmund Bartlett is calling on the local authorities and citizens to take greater steps to prevent unplanned housing development in his constituency, noting that this negatively affects water distribution.Bartlett made the call while speaking at last Friday's East Central St James Education Council's 2012-13 tertiary scholarship awards ceremony, held at Sunset Beach Resort and Spa in Montego Bay, where 35 tertiary-level students from the constituency were awarded with bursaries valued at J$2 million to fund their studies.In his address, Bartlett said during a tour of the constituency the previous day with representatives of the National Water Commission, the need for steady water supply came to his attention.\"Yesterday, we were able to outline to the communities that a programme of distribution is to be implemented to enable these communities to have water three to four days a week, so that there can be some adequacy to cover all the communities that are connected to those particular sources,\" Bartlett said.Informal settlementsHe blamed inadequate water distribution on the growth of informal settlements throughout the constituency, which he said was putting pressure on the system to meet all the needs.\"People are now building on top of the water tanks, meaning at higher elevation than the tanks, so the distribution - which is essentially gravity-fed - cannot reach you, because you are either at the level of the tanks or you are higher than the tanks,\" said Bartlett.The MP named several agencies that he said need to get active in enforcing proper zoning regulations, and also called on citizens to stand up against illegal water connections.\"The National Environment and Planning Agency, the parish council, and the planning authority have got to take this thing very seriously in hand, because it is clear that we are not able to provide the water resources in several of these communities apace with the demand,\" noted Bartlett.\"Our own environmental practices are diminishing the availability of these water sources, and we have to take note of it and deal with it.\"christopher.thomas@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7850, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4a7df8a22d0f5234", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:56:34.365", "title": "Hanover residents get land titles, celebrate Operation 'Pride'", "occurred_at": "2012-09-13T04:01:02", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120913/lead/lead93.html", "data": "WESTERN BUREAU:RESIDENTS OF the Elgin Town, Fisherman's Village and Bull Bay Operation Pride developments in Hanover now have good reasons to celebrate as last Saturday they received their certificate of titles from the Housing Agency of Jamaica (HAJ).\"I am happy that we finally have this title in hand,\" said Noel Myrie of Bull Bay who, along with his wife Garcia, turned up for the handover ceremony.\"It has changed our outlook on life as we now have something to call our own.\"The three Hanover communities have almost 500 lots combined.

public-sector pension reform and public-sector transformation.\"The tax reform for instance, by now a White Paper should have been tabled in Parliament,\" argued Shaw. \"It was actually promised to be tabled before the summer break.\"Shaw contended that the tax package was announced by Phillips in the delayed Budget presentation fell short of what was required of the proposed tax reform.\"Tax reform is different from a new tax package,\" Shaw argued. \"That is still to be done nobody is impressed, least of all the IMF, with what has been put forward so far, even in the Budget because tax reform is much more far reaching than what he has proposed so far.\"He said what the Minister announced in his Budget presentation was \"light years away\" from the fundamental proposals that are contained in the Green Paper that was tabled in Parliament as well as those from the private sector.gary.spaulding@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7855, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2e93c546b5d53d22", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:56:38.119", "title": "Rats rule Supreme", "occurred_at": "2012-09-13T04:01:02", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120912/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Barbara Gayle, Justice CoordinatorRodents, cockroaches creating health hazard in court buildingThe Supreme Court building in downtown Kingston has been infested with rats and cockroaches for several months now and some employees have described the situation as a health hazard.Some members of the court staff have expressed the view that very soon the court building, which is being refurbished next door to the derelict Attorney General's building, on Barry Street, will be taken over by the rodents.Fear is also being expressed that the staff and judges could become infected with leptospirosis.They are calling for the authorities to take quick action to remedy the situation.\"Cleaning material and disinfectant are scarce commodities and sometimes the janitorial workers have to take cleaning material from their homes,\" a member of staff disclosed.Yesterday morning the rats could be seen scurrying along the corridors of the courthouse going into manholes on the ground floor.A senior member of staff said he knew of no immediate plans to rid the building of the rats which have been scaring both workers and members of the public and \"posing a real health hazard\".\"The rats are barefaced enough to be running over the place including offices in the day but the number doubles during the nights and at that time the cockroaches are out crawling all over the place,\" a member of staff said.

However, Karl James, the general manager of JCPS, confirmed that talks were being held regarding the return of the Chinese firm, which would see their sugar being shipped from the Reynolds Pier, in St Ann, as part of the pool arrangement.\"PanCaribbean will not have their new port for next year, so their proposal is to work with JCPS to ship their sugar through the Ocho Rios port for this crop year. That request is now under consideration,\" James told The Gleaner.However, even if the deal with the JCPS works, the PCSC still wants to sell its sweetener to a separate buyer. Some producers are reportedly against the temporary arrangement, especially with no way to separate and determine each estate's sugar quality.\"That is the question being voiced by our directors, because the quality of the sugar from Frome has been a concern over the years, but they have given the undertaking that they are doing everything to improve on the quality, so that should not be an issue,\" James said.Impact of qualityHowever, Allan Rickards, chairman of the All Island Jamaica Cane Farmers Association (AIJCFA), is expressing concern about the impact of the quality of Frome's sugar on the cane farmers' remuneration.\"The quality of the sugar must be addressed before they are allowed to pool; it is also not good news for my members,\" said Rickards.Prior to the completion of the Government's divestment of sugar factories last year, both private and publicly-owned factories pooled their products and authorised JCPS, which markets the product.However, since then, the PCSC negotiated with the Jamaican Government for the right to sell its own sugar when it bought the Bernard Lodge, Frome and Monymusk factories.In a previous interview with The Gleaner, he identified Montego Bay and Monymusk as likely locations for the PCSC proposed port. At the time, he pointed out that the marketing, storage and distribution plans for the local market are already in place.mark.titus@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7861, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c2e0f023f3d62b80", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:56:42.585", "title": "Newly opened Northgate High School", "occurred_at": "2012-09-12T06:40:18", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120912/lead/lead91.html", "data": "Carl Gilchrist, Gleaner WriterEducating with a differenceWHITE RIVER, St Ann:NORTHGATE HIGH School, a church-based institution, opened its doors officially on Sunday evening in White River, St Ann, with a pledge to produce students not just academically excellent but strong on moral values and principles.The school, which had orientation last week, began officially on Monday with 15 students in a new building sitting on a hill overlooking the roadway that leads to Exchange, in the parish.Chairman of the school, Pastor Wesley Boynes, also chair of the Northgate Youth and Family Development Foundation, thanked members of that organisation who he said adopted and supported the school with their time, energy, commitment and resources.Boynes described the opening as historic in the educational landscape of Jamaica, saying it is a very unique response to the challenges, which face not only the educational sector in Jamaica, but the social and national landscape as a whole.DifferentAccording to Boynes, academic achievements do not in any way, equal preparation for life, but rather, prepares people to qualify for a job.He said Northgate High School would be different.Boynes said Northgate has designed a system, called the Character Development Programme, which will ensure that the boys will not only achieve academic excellence, but grow up to be strong men, dependable and wise leaders and loving and tender husbands and fathers.\"We do not want to be numbered among institutions that produce people who are very efficient in their professional skills, but once they exit their offices at the end of the day, they become dysfunctional in the other areas of their lives, because of the absence of internal building and development,\" Boynes pointed out.\"The educational process at this school will occur within the context of a strong emphasis on moral values and principles. Students must be very clear about their moral codes and the implications which face them if they ignore to conduct their lives accordingly,\" he added.Director of Region Six, Ministry of Education, Maxine Headlam, committed to providing the necessary technical assistance to ensure that the school becomes a success.In commending the Northgate Family Church on the move, Headlam said the church in Jamaica must revisit its former role as vanguards of education.Headlam challenged the school to become what it aspires to be.Meanwhile, director of the institution's sister school, Northgate College in Trinidad, Yolande La Pierre, said the new school is more than a place of certification.\"It is a place for growth and development.

The customer can rest assured that all service and diagnostic centres and workshops are equipped with new state-of-the-art equipment and a team of factory-trained technicians and automechanics.Naturally, the new corporate suite of offices have been exquisitely decorated, with accent and other walls bearing masses of Stewart family photographs, depicting the clan at work, play or marking memorable milestones in the business founded in 1938 by Lionel Arthur Stewart, father of Richard Stewart. barbara.ellington@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7863, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/73929370c9318bbf", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:56:44.185", "title": "THIS DAY IN 1962", "occurred_at": "2012-09-12T06:40:18", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120912/lead/lead93.html", "data": "Russia will fight for CubaThe Soviet Union promised today to defend Cuba with rockets and warned the United States an armed attack on the Marxist outpost in the Caribbean would plunge the world into a nuclear war.The tough Kremlin statement denounced as provocative President John F.

He said the behaviour is generally triggered by a situation where children try to take advantage of lack of strict supervision.ISSUES ADDRESSEDThe report took into account factors such as anger problems, conflicts leading to fights, underlying family issues (recognised after assess-ment), absentee parents and children living in environments they are uncomfortable with.\"In rural areas, parents establish informal boundaries, which are not agreed on by the child or children \u0085 . Another problem we encounter is that the line of communication is oftentimes blighted by other concerns including making ends meet, frustration, so what should be normal now becomes a luxury,\" said Gardner.He also indicated that there was a parental deficit, which gives rise to behaviour challenge in the children, noting that isolation of parents is almost a retrograde step.barrington.flemming@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7872, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8d4af860ab700418", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:56:50.810", "title": "Heroes' welcome", "occurred_at": "2012-09-12T06:40:18", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120911/lead/lead1.html", "data": "Andr\u00e9 Lowe, Senior Staff ReporterOlympians return to word of October celebrationsThe Government yesterday announced it would stage a special celebratory event in honour of the country's Olympians in October, during the Heroes weekend festivities, after the island's historic 12-medal haul at the London Games a few weeks ago.

Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade A.J. Nicholson said yesterday his office would be seeking to verify the statements, after which Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller would respond.But going one step further, Opposition Spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Dr Christopher Tufton described the statement as unfortunate and said if it were found to have been made by Mugabe, the Zimbabwean president would have a responsibility to shed light on his comments, as well as provide an apology.\"I think that he should be called on to provide an explanation as to what he meant. It's inappropriate and, frankly speaking, rude. He should apologise to the Jamaican people,\" Tufton declared.\"It certainly is in poor taste and does not generate confidence in the relationship. It is inappropriate and it threatens to undermine the relationship that Zimbabwe and the people of Zimbabwe have had with Jamaica and the people of Jamaica over many years,\" Tufton told The Gleaner.Tufton went on to add that the comments generate questions as to whether Mugabe should retain membership in the  Order of Jamaica, which was conferred on him during a state visit to the island back in 1996.\"If he thinks that way about Jamaica, then what I would certainly say is, why did he accept that award that was offered to him? Now that he has that impression of Jamaica, then perhaps he should consider returning the award and I have no difficulty with that.

I was teaching at the Holy Childhood Academy, but it closed in June. I've been to several interviews and one employer told me that the interview was good, but we are concerned that you won't be able to reach the board and some say they would call me back but their facial expressions say it all,\" she said.She noted that many parents at Holy Childhood Academy had complained to the school's administration, saying they were not comfortable with her teaching their children.\"I had situations where parents have gone to the administration to make complaints that they don't want no short person teaching their children and some, when they come to the classroom, you see it on their faces. There are those who support me to the fullest, but for the most part, there have been a lot of complaints about my height,\" she lamented.Sister also concernedLatty's sister, Cecile Cameron, also voiced her concern, saying she hopes something can be done to address the issue.\"She is currently unemployed and her height is a big issue, which should not happen and is like everybody is paying scant regard to the issue. I am really hoping something can be done,\" she said.Latty told The Gleaner she wrote to the Ministry of Education in April and after receiving a response signed by \"the minister of education\" in May - about possible employment - nothing has been forthcoming.However, when The Gleaner contacted Education Minister Ronald Thwaites, he said he knew nothing about the issue and would not be commenting.\"If that had come to my attention, something would have been done because that concerns me.

We have a good practice over the long term,\" Brown said.Specific disagreementsHowever, both Jamaica and the US have, in the past, had their disagreements over the extradition of specific individuals.Controversy shrouded the extradition of Richard 'Storyteller' Morrison in the early 1990s under the People's National Party administration.The Christopher 'Dudus' Coke extradition affair in 2010 strained relations with the US and is believed to have brought down former Prime Minister Bruce Golding.Extraditions to the US were energised in 1999 when the Jamaican Government, with the assistance of the US government, formed a special Jamaican Fugitive Apprehension Team to target and apprehend fugitives from the law in America.gary.spaulding@gleanerjm.com\n\n", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7888, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/795c6e3d6a8abb77", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:57:15.417", "title": "House leader wants absenteeism addressed", "occurred_at": "2012-09-11T03:37:08", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120910/lead/lead91.html", "data": "LEADER OF government business in the House of Representatives, Phillip Paulwell, says he is disappointed with the poor attendance record of some members of parliament at committee meetings.Paulwell noted that the leadership of most committees reside with the Opposition, which has the responsibility of convening the committee meetings and ensuring that members are properly informed about their sitting.\"I now intend to have discussion with the leader of opposition business to discuss these matters,\" Paulwell told The Gleaner.Paulwell noted that there are 63 members in the House of Representatives and, thus, if there are members who feel pressured, they can advise him and be relieved of such duties.Delroy Chuck, the man with whom Paulwell intends to speak, has said there is oftentimes a reasonable explanation for people missing committee meetings.Said Chuck: \"A number of persons serve on several committees and regrettable, especially members of the Opposition and members of the Government.

He will get the support of myself, as minister, and of the administration.\"WANING POPULARITYSince then, Ellington and the men and women under his command have seen their public approval rating plummet with the arrest and subsequent failure to charge two St James councillors in connection with the lottery scam, the arrest of a high-profile senior superintendent on corruption charges, and the fatal shooting of a pregnant woman in St Thomas, among other questionable incidents.But last Friday, Bunting told The Sunday Gleaner that his confidence in Ellington has not been shaken by recent incidents.\"I see no reason not to continue to give Ellington my support,\" said Bunting, even as he sought to distance the People's National Party (PNP) from calls for the resignation of the commissioner.Last week, an organisation linked to the PNP went public with its demand for Ellington's resignation, while persons close to the Government were telling friends and confidants that the new commissioner has already been identified.\"All that is left now is for the arranging of his compensation package and then Ellington will resign,\" one source close to the governing PNP told The Sunday Gleaner.\"His successor is already decided on, but it will not be the senior cop whose name is being bandied around,\" claimed the source.NOT PARTY'S POSITIONAs those whispers grew louder and the call for Ellington's resignation sounded from the PNP's headquarters - albeit from the party's youth organisation \u0097 Bunting said this was not the official position of the party.\"The position expressed by Junior Rose (president of the PNP Youth Organisation) is his personal position and not that of the party.\" said Bunting.\"He has a right to his own opinions, but not his own facts. I need to make it clear that even without the exact numbers, I know that fatal shootings by the police were down about 15 per cent from 2010 to 2011 and that trend has continued with an approximately 15 per cent reduction year to date when compared with last year,\" added Bunting.The security minister's comments came hours after the Opposition Jamaica Labour Party demanded that he should distance the administration from the call for Ellington's resignation.\"Ellington, in my judgement, has been one of the best commissioners of police that Jamaica has had since Independence, and I am extremely disappointed that the minister of national security, Peter Bunting, has not come out to rebuke the outrageous call from the president of the PNP Youth Organisation,\" declared Delroy Chuck, the opposition spokesman on national security.\"I consider the call by the PNP Youth Organisation for Ellington to resign to be preposterous and bordering on almost insanity,\" Chuck told The Sunday Gleaner.\"I think the present commissioner has served this country very well. He has shown a level of professionalism and is definitely focused on removing indiscipline, corruption and unprofessionalism from the (police) force,\" added Chuck.According to Chuck, if there are members of the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) who want to see Ellington replaced, it would be because of his determination to remove corrupt and inefficient cops from the system.HIGH MARKS FOR ELLINGTONThe opposition spokesman said he would grade Ellington at a seven or eight out of 10 for his performance as commissioner since he was appointed to the post in 2010.\"I would not give him a perfect score because there are challenges in the force and, certainly, \u0085 there are concerns about the number of police killings, even though it is lower than it was in previous years.\"And certainly, there are many challenges to his leadership because of a lack of resources and the difficulty he has with the police force itself.\"Rose's call for the immediate resignation of Ellington was based on what he said was \"the alarming number of extrajudicial killings by police officers with little effort or success from the police commissioner to stem this frightening trend\".According to Rose, Ellington's tenure has been one fraught with the killing of hundreds of Jamaicans by the police.\"The PNPYO believes that the commissioner's jacket is soiled by the blood of those who have been gunned down by the police,\" added Rose.According to Rose: \"The PNPYO believes in light of the clear failure of Commissioner Owen Lloyd Ellington due to an evident increase in police extrajudicial killings and a decrease in the respect for citizens' rights to life, it is time for a new commissioner with a new vision and direction to assume leadership of the JCF.\"- Peter Bunting, minister of National SecurityI see no reason not to continue to give Ellington my \nsupport. \u0085 Even without the exact numbers, I know that fatal shootings \nby the police were down about 15 per cent from 2010 to 2011 and that \ntrend has continued with an approximately 15 per cent reduction year to \ndate when compared with last year.- Delroy Chuck, opposition spokesman on National SecurityEllington\n \u0085 has been one of the best commis-sioners of police that Jamaica has \nhad since Independence \u0085 .

They were pushed into grade nine at one of the top high schools in Montego Bay, St James, when they were reading at primary-school level.But God sent them an angel, who managed to transform their lives and move them to an academic level that underscores the maxim 'Every child can learn'.As public debate rages over subpar performances in the 2012 Caribbean Secondary Examinations Certificate (CSEC) examinations, particularly in the core subjects of English language and mathematics, the academic staff of the Montego Bay High School for Girls has demonstrated that, given the opportunity and dedicated, innovative tutoring, most children can achieve success.In doing so, Montego Bay High debunked the myth that it was performing well only because it was blessed with the brightest and the best students from St James and its environs.Andrea Wakeland, who heads the school's English Department, detailed the chronology of a determined group of teachers who, in a radical move two years ago, succeeded in transforming a class of students from possible doom to exciting success.In doing so, the teachers lifted the self-esteem of the group of teens, who had entered the institution three years earlier.Significantly, the students raised their grades above even the most optimistic expectation.CHALLENGING ROADAfter three years of painstaking work, which, at times, left Wakeland in \"despair\", her spirit soared after one of her \"special\" charges had been successful in seven CSEC subjects, attaining a grade one in English language.Other students were also successful, while others left the institution far more equipped than they had entered.Wakeland was hesitant to speak about her success when The Sunday Gleaner made contact with her, but she agreed after it was pointed out that many struggling institutions could take a lesson from the experience of the school.\"Montego Bay High has traditionally done well, and we were sometimes criticised that this was so because we received some of the best students in the west,\" said Wakeland.\"While it is true that we usually get very good students, I really believe that if some of these good students had gone to other schools, they may not have done as well as they did because I firmly believe it has to do with the strategies that we have employed and the dedication of the staff, especially in my department.\"Her pronouncements were based on a cadre of students who were sent to the institution by the Ministry of Education three years ago, allegedly in error.\"A rather high number of students (who sat the) Grade Nine Achievement Test were sent to Montego Bay High. Traditionally, we don't get them because it is a small school.\"COULD BARELY READWakeland said when she came in contact with the students for the first time, she did not know who they were.\"But within a week or two, I quickly realised that these were not our regular students, many of them could barely read,\" said Wakeland.\"I discovered, after I had done my diagnosis, I could not allow them to read aloud in class because it was embarrassing,\" she said.\"They were at a level where comprehension and the identity of simple words were major obstacles to them.\"It was clear that when these students were to be streamed for grade 10, they would all end up in one class - the lowest level in the system.Disturbed by the plight of the students, Wakeland was spurred into action. \"I requested that I get that class to teach and that I would assume responsibility of form teacher,\" she told The Sunday Gleaner.Wakeland said that the first order of business in her class was to be candid, by speaking frankly to them without causing further harm.She also appealed to the students to be circumspect about the exercise being undertaken to prevent or minimise potential ridicule.\"I promised to do everything that was humanly possible to assist, as I knew I had to get them to believe that I cared about them and that I wanted them to do well because they were very suspicious,\" she said.\"First of all, I worked a lot on their self-esteem, even changing hairstyles and the way they carry themselves in order to blend into the school.\"Wakeland said it was clear that the group, having entered the institution two years after the other students in their year group, felt that they were not a part of the school. She added that the class was surprisingly receptive to her suggestions.BUILDING TRUST\"We formed a pact in the class where they would follow their teacher, even in areas that seemed unorthodox, and nothing would leave the classroom \u0085 . I was always very conscious that if I lost them, in the thought that they were humiliating the remainder of the school, they would get resentful.\"According to Wakeland: \"As far as their cognition goes, at the time, our principal, Faith Clemmings, now retired, was most supportive.\"I said to her that I wanted to do something radical by not giving them the option to choose between English literature and office administration because I knew that most of them would have chosen office administration. They were not reading well, so they would have known that they couldn't do the literature.\"Wakeland recalled that she received permission from Clemmings to speak with the parents, who were also receptive to the idea.\"Technically, we were not doing literature. We devoted all those sessions to get the students to read more.\"She sensitively explained to the grade-10 students that she would treat them as if she had got them in grade seven. But, even then, she had to resort to the primary-school level.\"I started with the grades four, five and six workbooks and started working on specific areas such as subject-verb agreement and use of the past tense - the two big areas that impede students who speak primarily Patois,\" she recalled.\"So we did a lot of work with that and, in those so-called literature sessions, what we did was read, read, read. When they couldn't read, I would read.\"With the success of this programme, Wakeland has sought to share her idea with teachers at other schools during regional workshops.I started with the grades four, five and six workbooks and started working on specific areas \u0085 that impede students who speak primarily Patois.&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 7891, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7dfb2de16ed44b86", "created_at": "2012-10-18T15:57:17.053", "title": "Don't be like Jamaicans - Mugabe", "occurred_at": "2012-09-11T03:37:08", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120909/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Zimbabwe's president reportedly labels J'can men as drunkards always high on the weedA media entity in Zimbabwe has reported that the country's president, Robert Mugabe, has taken an unprovoked swipe at Jamaica and, in particular, Jamaican men.In an online article posted  last Friday on the website of Nehanda Radio, a Zimbabwean radio station, Mugabe, who was conferred with the Order of Jamaica during a state visit to the island in 1996, is quoted as labelling Jamaican men as drunkards who are perennially high on marijuana.According to the report, the controversial Mugabe made the comments during a 'distinguished lecture' at a university function dubbed 'Research and Intellectual Expo 2012'.The Nehanda Radio story speculated that the 88-year-old Zimbabwean strongman may have stoked a diplomatic tiff with Jamaica by describing the island as \"a country of marijuana smokers, where women are now taking charge since men are always sloshed (drunk)\".According to the article, Mugabe, who neither smokes nor drinks alcohol, urged Zimbabweans never to follow in the footsteps of Jamaicans, whose influence on the country is all too pervasive.FREE TO LIGHT UPEven though marijuana is illegal in Jamaica, the Nehanda Radio reported that Mugabe said that Jamaicans are free to light up spliffs.\"In Jamaica, they have freedom to smoke mbanje, varume vanogara vakadhakwa (men are always drunk) and universities are full of women,\" the article reports Mugabe as saying.\"The men want to sing and do not go to colleges vamwe vanobva vamonwa musoro (some are dreadlocked).

In all that he's done - whether it's good or bad - I hope and pray that it's for the betterment of the people,\" said Sizzla in response to his critics.Late yesterday, Foreign Affairs Minister A.J.
