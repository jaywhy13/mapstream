We do it by the rules,\" the veteran educator said.She agreed that the culling of students might give an unfair advantage to the schools that do it in terms of performance on the external exams.\"The schools that don't screen and do well, like Pembroke Hall, should get high commendation,\" said McNeil.fear of being labelled She reasoned that some administrators may have resorted to the illegal practice out of fear of being labelled a failing school.But the education ministry is not accepting that position and it has directed that public primary schools should \"accept children on a first come, first served basis with regard to students who reside in proximity to the school\".The education ministry decree, which was addressed to regional directors, school board chairmen and principals of all state-operated educational institutions at the primary level, also stated that children should only be turned away from a public primary school if there is no more space.\"It has come to the attention of the Ministry of Education that some public schools at the primary level have been administering screening examinations to students before they can be considered for admission.It is reported that schools are charging as much as $8,000 for these screening examinations,\" read the opening paragraph of the ministry bulletin addressing \"admission to public primary-level schools\".The education ministry reminded principals and school boards that Section 23 subsection 2(a) of the Regulation Act 1980 states that \"no person who is eligible for admission as a student to a public educational institution shall be refused admission thereto except on the grounds that accommodation is not available in that institution\".The ministry also instructed the public schools to end the unlawful screening of the young students.\"The Grade One Individual Learning Profile is the only official instrument endorsed by the Ministry of Education for students at the primary level and was enforced to access students' readiness at the formal start of the learning stage.Students should not be subjected to any other measure of testing that would deem them ineligible for entry to school,\" read another section of the bulletin.The ministry reminded administrators of public primary schools that the students they accept are being prepared for secondary and higher levels of learning and as a result, the primary level should be treated and regarded as foundational.\"In all cases, the rights of the child must remain at the forefront and access and equity in the educational school system must be preserved. Schools are asked to cooperate with the ministry as we work together to uphold the mantra 'Every Child Can Learn: Every Child Must Learn'.\"tyrone.reid@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ",

It's ridiculous,\" said Scott, who is the chairman of Musson Jamaica Limited.\"Jamaica just does not have a  property-tax system that is effective at all. It is non-existent,\" he said during a Gleaner Editors' Forum held at the newspaper's central Kingston offices on Friday. Scott added: \"So you have situations where the amount levied on properties are so immaterial that a person in Portmore (St Catherine) is paying not that much different from what I am paying for my house and I built it five years ago.\" Parish councils not capable Scott has also questioned whether the persons who have responsibility for setting property tax rates are even \"capable of making the assessments to set the right rate\". He took aim at the parish councils, arguing that they are not capable of collecting property taxes. \"If I don't pay my property taxes in Miami, they go and auction the property. The next time I go there it's not even a discussion, they just go and auction the property,\" he emphasised. First vice-president of the JCC, Francis Kennedy, agreed, charging that parish councils are now collecting less than 50 per cent of the property taxes they should be collecting. In the Corporate Area, Kennedy said the Kingston and St Andrew Corporation was doing \"slightly\" better in collecting nearly 60 per cent of all property taxes. \"If the true level of property taxes were being collected, the subvention that the Treasury is giving the parish councils would be zero instead of $500 million a year,\" he said. \"If they had a proper system of collection, the parish councils would be self-sufficient,\" he insisted. JCC President Milton Samuda said in addressing this issue, there has to be the corresponding capacity building within the parish councils. To support his position, Samuda said if the proper local government reforms were implemented, councillors \"could end up handling serious amounts of money\". He cautioned: \"And they will need training and all sorts of things to properly deal with it ... because what will result, they may not be able to deal with.\" &#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4705, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2558e00f67ada525", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:17:14", "title": "Don't expect Beijing repeat - Anderson", "occurred_at": "2012-05-14 01:56:07", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120514/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Nedburn Thaffe, Gleaner WriterRenowned pollster and first vice-president of the Jamaica Olympic Association (JOA), Don Anderson, is cautioning fans against placing their expectations too high for another record medal haul at London 2012.\"(Beijing) is going to be very difficult to repeat,\" Anderson said, noting that public expectation for London is very high.He was speaking at the First Global staff awards dinner at the Wyndham hotel in Kingston last Saturday night.Anderson, while conceding that Jamaican athletes are still not doing too badly on the track, pointed to the ominous 'handwriting on the wall'.\"Have we reflected on what happened in the Penn Relays recently? The United States (US) won all six relays. Yesterday (Saturday) in the Diamond League, we were beaten in (both men's and women's) 100 metres, \" Anderson said.Reshaped track-and-field programmes He noted that his uncertainty was also based on the fact that a number of countries, including the US, have reshaped their track-and-field programme and would be heading into the games with vengeance.\"We are running very well but guess what, a lot of the big countries in the world were particularly jealous of the fact that a little country with 2.8 million people could match strides with the United States for example, with (a population) of 250 million people,\" he said.\"Since Beijing, a lot of the big countries in the world where track and field is a big sport have sat down, retrospected and introspected and have come up with programmes that are going to try to cut the ground from under the Jamaican athletes' feet.\"He said with this in mind, Jamaican athletes would have to approach the Olympics with the view that it will be Jamaica competing against the rest of the world.\"We are going to see Americans coming, and not just Carmelita Jeter, so it's going to be tough,\" he saidAnderson added that already the JOA was seeing signs that the expectation of the athletes is high in the United Kingdom (UK) diaspora and the rest of the world.\"We have several million Jamaicans living in London and, of course, people are going to come from everywhere. People are now thinking, 'The athletes are going to be in London, we can get them to a function' and everybody wants them to come to a function.\"He added: \"Already we have had to politely say to hundreds of people, there is no way you can have the athletes at your function.\"We are hard-pressed to tell persons in the UK that before the event and maybe right after the closing ceremony, we can have some of the athletes, but not during the Olympics. It is very difficult for some of them to understand this because everybody wants to be able to shake hands with (Usain) Bolt and the rest of the athletes, but that is to the detriment of their performance and we can't risk it.\"In the meantime, Anderson said with the poor economic landscape that exists in Jamaica, financial institutions must now look at ways to tap into the earning power of sports.\"Sports is such big business that regardless of what happens in the Jamaican economy, we are going to have sportspersons who are going to make a lot of money,\" he said.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4706, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1fddc875f11e40f4", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:17:15", "title": "A run for mama", "occurred_at": "2012-05-14 01:56:07", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120514/lead/lead3.html", "data": "\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4707, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/71509da8688526e4", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:17:16", "title": "JDIP halt will cost taxpayers, says MP Mair", "occurred_at": "2012-05-14 01:56:07", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120514/lead/lead4.html", "data": "NORTH EAST St Catherine Member of Parliament Gregory Mair is arguing that Cabinet erred when it decided to put a hold on projects under the Jamaica Development Infrastructure Programme (JDIP) shortly after a change of political administration in January.Mair said the decision was likely to result in taxpayers paying more to complete projects on which works have commenced.\"You had these projects under JDIP which were under construction.

I am going to use it to do infrastructure, which are well needed in the constituency,\" the MP added.Despite the disclosure by the JEEP secretariat that a subcontractor, Construction Solutions, has been identified to undertake the project in Sandy Corner and other areas of the constituency, Mair can't wait for them to get off the ground.\"I need to start those projects but there's no money,\" the MP said.\"I followed up with the NWA (National Works Agency) last week and they told me they have no funds at this time,\" Mair said.This programme is under the same JDIP (Jamaica Development Infrastructure Programme), it just has another name.But Lucille Brodber, project manager for JEEP, told The Gleaner that no such woes exist.\"I don't know about unavailability of funds,\" Brodber said, while adding that Mair should seek to contact her for guidance in relation to the projects in his constituency.Preparing for hurricanesIn the meantime, as the hurricane season fast approaches, North East St Catherine constituents such as Gray are watching the skies and fearful of the impact adverse weather conditions could have on their lives.When The Gleaner visited Sandy Corner recently, Gray along with elderly resident John Ferrant showed our news team trenches that had to be dug to protect their dirt pathway from run-off.Gray, who has been waiting a long time for deliverance told, The Gleaner that the fact that stones and river shingle were dropped off in the community to undertake the work gives him some degree of confidence that the problem will be addressed.But he won't celebrate until the job is done.\"I have had the experience to have seen material dropped off and taken away, but I hope that is not what is going to happen now,\" Gray said.In the meantime, the MP is hopeful that when the projects commence, members of the constituency will be able to gain some form of useful employment.\"The good thing about walls in comparison to roads is that walls are highly labour intensive ... anything that can create labour is more than welcome.\"Mair said: \"The need for employment is so great, I guess it's better than nothing.\"daraine.luton@gleanerjm.com&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4711, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/28b5753cd6e56c74", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:17:19", "title": "Gov't signs off on nurses' reclassification", "occurred_at": "2012-05-14 01:56:07", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120514/lead/lead8.html", "data": "Nedburn Thaffe, Gleaner WriterEdith Allwood Anderson, past president of the Nurses' Association of Jamaica (NAJ), says the profession has secured a major victory, following the announcement that Cabinet has signed off on the long overdue reclassification for nurses.\"The reclassification for nurses means that somebody has looked on the worth and the work of nurses and has re-evaluated it and has moved to assign what you call a payment package to it,\" Allwood Anderson said.Health Minister Dr Fenton Ferguson, speaking at an  event marking International Nurses Day and the launch of National Nurses Week at the Terra Nova All-Suite Hotel in Kingston on Saturday,  announced the Cabinet's decision.The minister, however, added that discussion is still ongoing as to the date of its implementation.Next moveResponding to the news, Allwood Anderson said \"What is necessary next is for us to move to a payment schedule against the background of a difficult economic situation in our country\".The association's current president, Anthonette Patterson-Bartley, commended the Government for its latest move.\"The Nurses' Association is happy and pleased that this reclassification has been approved. It says to the Nurses' Association that the ministers have recognised that there is a need for our reclassification to get off the ground,\" Patterson-Bartley said.The NAJ and the Government have long knocked heads over the need for a reclassification. In 2009, the Industrial Dispute Tribunal ruled that the Government should confirm a date for the implementation of the reclassification exercise.The Government at the time did not immediately set a date for the reclassification exercise, and that led to a series of protests by the NAJ.In the meantime, Ferguson said the Government is committed to building a paediatric hospital in western Jamaica.\"I recognise that the children's hospital responds to 0-12 (age group) so there is a gap as it relates to our 13-17 so we need to work to close this gap.\"\"We have also lost many of our patients trying to get from western Jamaica to children's hospital,\" Ferguson said.He added that research has already been conducted to look into the need for such a hospital in the western end and said that his ministry is now seeking to determine the kind of \"private-public model\".\u00a0\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4712, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/018221e7fc8049ce", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:17:20", "title": "Better financial backing needed for farmers and youths", "occurred_at": "2012-05-14 01:56:07", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120514/lead/lead9.html", "data": "IS ROGER Clarke a farmer or a woodcutter? We really wonder. Sure, he is one of the largest producers of sugar cane on the island, but the slaughter to which he has agreed to subject the agriculture sector this fiscal year is mind-boggling.If the Standing Finance Committee of Parliament does its work properly starting Tuesday, it should notice the 67 per cent reduction in the capital budget for the Rural Agricultural Development Authority (RADA).The estimates of expenditure for 2012-2013 tabled in the House of Representatives last week by Finance Minister Dr Peter Phillips show that the capital budget for RADA has been chopped from $118 million last fiscal year to $39 million this year.The capital budget for RADA is used to provide subsidies to small farmers in the form of seeds, seedlings, pesticides, tools equipment, farmhouses and water tanks. The budget also supports the training of farmers, the aim of which is to assist in increasing the productivity and improving the standard of living of small farmers.It is a known fact that small farmers comprise the majority of Jamaica's agricultural sector, many of whom are ill-equipped and without the requisite capital to make a decent living.We are not making an argument for the use of taxpayers' money to subsidise farmers to form fool. We feel, however, that the Government has an obligation to assist struggling farmers with agricultural inputs. That is one sure way of breaking inter-generational poverty, reducing unemployment and enabling Jamaica's food safety.The Gavel notes, with dismay, that the capital budget for RADA has been cut by $99 million in two years. And it makes no sense Clarke points to an increase of the recurrent budget from $153.7 million to $170.8 million. That money is to pay bills and for general administration of the authority.This is shocking, especially when one considers Clarke's declaration that enemy No. 1 for his administration is idle lands. One wonders if the signal being sent by the Government is that the troop that will eventually occupy and farm those idle lands will be people with deep pockets who can afford SUVs onto large tracks of lands.Clarke must indicate, clearly, the method to such madness.Youth and CultureBut it is not only in the area of agriculture that The Gavel has seen worrying proposed budget cuts. The Youth and Culture capital budget indicates that the Government has shelved plans of building the Youth Information Centres that have been long promised to the nation's youths.In the 2010-2011 fiscal year, $54 million was spent on these centres, and by the 2011-2012 financial year $35 million was expended on them.To the best of our knowledge, all the centres have not been built, yet not even a penny has been set aside in the budget for these facilities.Youth information centres are cyber-caf\u00e9s which run programmes including counselling, entrepreneurship classes and educational support for young people.In January, Lisa Hanna, the minister of youth and culture, announced that the Inter-American Development Bank will be spending US$11 million to fund the development of a youth information centre and National Youth Service training facilities in Spanish Town, St Catherine, and May Pen, Clarendon.\"The youth is a critical population and faces many challenges. Persons under the age of 30 commit 75 per cent of Jamaica's crimes, much of that percentage is unskilled or has not passed a single subject. I have also taken note of Clarendon, St Catherine, St Andrew, St James and Kingston, the five parishes where crime is rampant. That is why it is important that these two centres are constructed in Spanish Town and May Pen,\" Hanna said at the contract signing.Less talk more actionWe refuse to continue applauding announcements and contract signings. We want to see concrete pouring. We acknowledge that it takes cash to care, and the Government, based on the budget it presented, has given us no reason to feel the project will be completed before the end of the this fiscal year, as was promised.There is an urgent need for Minister Hanna to explain to the young people what her government intends to do in relation to the Youth Information Centres.We beseech the Standing Finance Committee to seek answers on behalf of the country's youths.There is also a need for urgent answers on the portfolio responsibility of Dr Wykeham McNeill.Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller needs to indicate whether the ministry headed by McNeill is still called Tourism and Entertainment.In the estimates of expenditure, we notice it is only referred to as the Ministry of Tourism.Most Jamaicans will recall that former Prime Minister Bruce Golding stripped Rudyard Spencer of portfolio responsibility for environment and did not tell him.In fact, it was in the estimates of expenditure that Spencer and all Jamaicans found out that he was the Minister of Health and not Minister of Health and Environment.thegavel@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4713, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/532e702bbbd20918", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:17:20", "title": "Not a dime for Fresh Start", "occurred_at": "2012-05-14 01:56:07", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120514/lead/lead91.html", "data": "Daraine Luton, Senior Staff ReporterThe government has dropped the axe on the budget for the National Transformation Programme, a civil society-led, value-based programme which was led by the Rev Al Miller.In the last three years, the programme received more than $32 million from the budget to undertake its activities.But in the latest estimates of expenditure tabled in the House of Representatives, the National Transformation Programme did not receive a penny.\"I think we have to respect the reality of the financial crunch facing the country and therefore the Government and its decision making,\" Miller said in response to the cut.\"Usually in tight budgetary times you have to make some choices as to what you cut so I would trust the wisdom of the leadership in their decision making,\" he added.Miller noted, however, that he is not au fait with the operations of the transformation programme.\"I had taken a leave of absence and I never really returned to it,\" Miller said.Taking leaveIn 2010, Miller took leave of the programme, also known as Fresh Start Jamaica, after he was charged with harbouring a fugitive and perverting the course of justice.His arrest arose out of his involvement with Christopher 'Dudus' Coke. Miller was found in the company of fugitive Coke on the Mandela Highway in St Catherine.Coke was subsequently extradited to the United States where he pleaded guilty to racketeering and assault charges.The programme, branded Fresh Start Jamaica, aims to mobilise, coordinate and energise a process of positive renewal for the Jamaican people, by the Jamaican people.On Saturday, Miller told The Gleaner that he does not think it was axed from the budget by the new Government because the programme began under a Jamaica Labour Party administration.\"I am one who believes that the political machinery is maturing because the national transformation programme, as we had outlined it, embraced the Values and Attitude Programme from the Patterson administration and simply expanded into some additional dimensions,\" Miller said.He added: \"I believe that both sides have been committed to the principle, it is now to the degree that they can apply the practice and that's left to be seen.\"In the meantime, Burchell Whiteman, special advisor to Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller, in whose Office the programme falls, said it has not been scrapped.\"The concept remains, the programmes remains and the objectives are the same,\" Whiteman told The Gleaner.He said, however, that the programme is being revisited and is to be incorporated with the community renewal programme, which is coordinated by the Planning Institute of Jamaica. \n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4714, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/da5e924059ec2ca2", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:17:21", "title": "Roads get less from gas tax", "occurred_at": "2012-05-14 01:56:07", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120514/lead/lead92.html", "data": "WHEN IT was in Opposition, the People's National Party complained bitterly that the then Government was not honouring its commitment to put a prescribed per cent of the fuel tax into the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF).But, in his first full budget since taking over as finance minister in January, Dr Peter Phillips has signalled his intention to reduce the amount of funds from the gas tax that will flow into the RMF.The estimates of expenditure tabled on Thursday shows that a total of $1.4 billion dollars is budgeted to flow into the fund which shows a drop from the $1.5 billion last year.When Finance Minister Audley Shaw introduced the fuel tax in 2008, he promised that 20 per cent of the fuel tax would be paid into the RMF in the first year and thereafter increase the amount to 35 per cent.Consumers pay a special consumption tax of $8.75 per litre on fuel.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4715, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c2ad9d72d3910ddb", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:17:23", "title": "Parliamentarians attend trust-building conference", "occurred_at": "2012-05-14 01:56:07", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120514/lead/lead93.html", "data": "GOVERNOR GENERAL Patrick Allen will this morning open the 37th Commonwealth Parliamen-tary Association (CPA) Regional Conference in St Andrew.The opening ceremony will take place at 9 a.m. in the Montego Suite of the Jamaica Pegasus.The conference, which is being held under the theme 'Low Citizen Confidence in Governance: How Can Parliamentarians Build Trust in Caribbean Legislatures?', ends on Friday.Some 100 delegates from Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Montserrat, St Lucia, St Christopher and Nevis, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica are expected to attend.\"The CPA is made up of 18 branches from 17 countries and consists of Commonwealth Parliamentarians who are united by their respect for the rule of law, democracy and individual rights and freedoms, without regard to gender, race, religion or culture,\" Conference coordinator and clerk of the Houses of Parliament, Heather Cooke, told the Jamaica Information Service recently.She said it \"will be a cause for reflection among parliamentarians in light of the theme.

She gripped the edge of the seat she sat on and swallowed hard.Once.Twice.\"We had just come back from a Jehovah's Witnesses Convention in Kingston. My mother operated a shop and she said she was going to bake. But I went to bed before her. Next thing I remember is waking up after 12 and seeing her with a machete,\" said Megan now 26, but who was then weeks away from entering the University of the West Indies.\"She gave me the phone and told me to call the police and I did - 994-3333,\" Megan recalled, saying the number must have been programmed in the phone.She managed to tell the cops to come to the Thomas' house and hung up.She would wait, and she and her mother would fight alone, as the police later claimed \"they came but, did not see anything, so they left\".\"My mother handed me the machete, and she began wrestling with him. When they were wrestling, she told me to chop him,\" Megan recounted.She raised the machete three times, and recalled the attacker saying that she had chopped her mother.In the confusion, shock and trauma, she believed she had killed the woman who brought her into the world.Stunned, Megan threw herself on the ground beside her mother's body in despair and sorrow.\"He started kicking me in the eye as I lay on the floor,\" she recalled, again fighting back tears.With blood everywhere, she managed to run into another room that was in darkness as the assailant went to the fridge, took a drink and came in search of her.small spaceShe tried desperately to crawl under a bed and recalled the difficulty getting her entire body underneath, as the bed had two drawers and only offered a small space between the base and ground.Eventually she did.\"He started to chop under the bed. I had to move my body up and down so the machete did not catch me.\" He pulled out the drawers and took some of her underwear to tie his wounds.\"He told me to come out and help him tie his hand. I told him that I would come out on one condition - that he should go into the other room and see if my mother was ok,\" she recalled.Somewhere in the process, the attacker opened a back door, and she bolted from under the bed, out the door and into the night, in search of help.She ran to the neighbours across the road and then to the police station.Her cries, for the loss, were the beginning of the end for the accused.Jungle justice was swift in his demise, as within 24 hours, he died just as violently as he had taken her mother's life.Eight years on, with her UWI degree, Megan is determined to make a contribution in the field of media. Just like Megan Thomas before her.But getting here wasn't easy.She had to be treated for post-traumatic stress, plus receive medical treatment for her eyes from the blows she received.Clearly still in pain, she takes it a day at a time.Now there is sadness when she goes to the Jehovah's Witnesses memorials as members of that religious family honour their dead.Now there is sadness as one of the fallen soldiers she mourns is her own mother, taken violently, untimely.\"It's an irreplaceable loss,\" she said, \"a painful loss.\"&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4717, "model":

and if you feel that your trading partner is acting in a way that is not in keeping with the treaty, you have a clear remedy and you deal with it,\" said Samuda who is also the chairman of the

protect the local industry from the Trinidadians.Yesterday, the responses to Samuda were swift and brutal.\"The front-page comments in The Gleaner by Mr Milton Samuda would be ridiculous if it weren't for the position he holds,\" declared chairman of Wisynco Trading, Joseph Mahfood.According to Mahfood, any objective look at the facts will show that Jamaican manufacturers are at a disadvantage to their Trinidadian counterparts who get strong support from their government.\"The margin gatherers at the Jamaica Chamber (of Commerce) should protect the JMA, its members, and persons employed to the manufacturing sector, who purchase your products daily,\" charged Mahfood.Mair disappointedHe was supported by the opposition spokes-person on industry, commerce and energy, Gregory Mair, who expressed disappointment at Samuda's pronouncements.According to Mair, Samuda needs to say if he expects \"Jamaican manufacturers, on their own, to take on the Trinidad and Tobago manufacturers and the T&amp;T government on the issue of subsidies ... or if JAMPRO is inclined to support the trading of subsidised goods from Trinidad to the detriment of our local manufacturers\".Mair, who was a state minister in the previous Jamaica Labour Party administration, argued that it is time for the Government to support local manufacturers and give strong consideration to imposing a special duty on manufactured goods out of Trinidad.\"Jamaica can level the playing field if T&amp;T is not willing,\" declared Mair.See related story: Jamaica's tax dollars creating jobs in Trinidad\n&#13;\n

The judge found that the Crown witnesses were not reliable and there was a failure on the Crown to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the attorneys argued.The defence lawyers pointed out that from the first day of the trial it was disclosed that men had fired at the police vehicle but the wrong vehicle was photographed.They said one of the witnesses said he knew Coke but had identified Coke's cousin in a photograph to be Coke.witnesses discreditedAccording to the defence lawyers, the witnesses were discredited during cross-examination and the identification was flawed.They stressed that the surveyor took measurements and made a sketch based on the statements given by the prosecution witnesses as to where the men were when they were allegedly shooting and where the members of the security forces were\"So it cannot be said that the prosecution was ambushed,\" said one lawyerEvidence was given at the trial that Coke and a group of men fired at members of the security forces between 11:30 a.m. and midday on May 24, 2010.The police had gone into west Kingston to search for Coke's brother, Christopher 'Dudus' Coke, for whom they had a warrant for his extradition to the USA.After he was extradited, he pleaded guilty to charges of assault and racketeering but has not yet been sentenced.'Livity' was freed of charges of illegal possession of firearm and shooting with intent at the end of a lengthy trial in the Gun Court.Three policemen had testified that during the unrest in west Kingston in May 2010, Coke was one of a group of men who fired at members of the security forces.But a land surveyor testified that he visited the area, took measurements and prepared a sketch which revealed that the location where the witnesses said Coke had fired from was more than 390 feet and not 30 feet as the policemen had testified.difficult to identifyAn ophthalmologist said it would be challenging and difficult for the naked eye to identify someone beyond a distance of 150 feet.Llewellyn said when the defence was going to use expert witnesses then \"the rules of fairness dictates that this be disclosed in a timely manner to the prosecution so we can know what we are to meet and can consult with the expert\".Llewellyn referred to a case which was decided by the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) and said \"this case exemplifies judicial recognition of the highest level of the obligations of the defence to disclose expert reports they intend to rely on to the prosecution within a minimum of 20 days before the trial\".She said it would enable the prosecution to consult with its own expert and also to get further instructions from its witnesses.\"In some instances, it could save judicial time as we could opt to discontinue the case if our expert agrees with the defence's expert\" said Llewellyn.\"It is imperative that these best practices are observed as the Crown does not have a right of appeal from verdicts or during the course of a trial if the ruling of a court on a matter of law or procedure is adverse to the Crown.\"This is in the spirit of fairness because the pendulum of justice must swing both ways for the prosecution and the defence; it cannot only be stuck in favour of the defence.The CCJ case which Llewellyn was referring to was the Barbadian case of Frank Errol Gibson against the attorney general in which the CCJ law lords held that, \"we adjudged that the defence was not obliged to disclose the contents of any report from the expert if the latter was not going to be called to give evidence at the trial.\"But we decided that if the defence proposed to call the expert to give evidence, then the defence was obliged to share his/her report with the Crown.\"Llewellyn has made a special appeal for lawyers at the private bar to heed the judgment of the CCJ in the interest of justice and fairness.barbara.gayle@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4723, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/be302360f8876148", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:17:30", "title": "Stop lights to join crime fight", "occurred_at": "2012-05-13 01:38:27", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120513/lead/lead51.html", "data": "Tyrone Reid, Senior Staff ReporterIn a bid to prevent a number of serious crimes which have been committed against motorists at stop lights, the Ministry of Transport and Works is considering a system of 'flashing red lights' at select locations in Kingston and St Andrew.Under the proposed anti-crime measure, between the hours of 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. each day, motorists approaching the lights will see the red flashing constantly.This would be a signal that motorists should stop briefly to ensure that the way is clear and proceed through the intersection when it is safe to do so.The anti-crime measure, requested by the police, will initially affect all stop lights in the heart of the country's capital - downtown Kingston.The flashing red light initiative is the brainchild of Senior Superintendent of Police Radcliffe Lewis, who heads the Jamaica Constabulary Force's traffic division.The idea was outlined in a missive Lewis sent to Earl Patterson, acting CEO of the National Works Agency, in March.The letter was also copied to Dr Omar Davies, minister of transport and works, and Owen Ellington, commissioner of police.\"Police statistics have shown that over the years a number of serious crimes, including murder, shooting, robberies and carjacking have taken place at different locations in the Corporate Area when motorists are waiting at traffic lights for their signals during certain times of the early mornings,\" read a section of Lewis' letter.\"In addition to this, some motorists take their chance of going through the 'red light' because of fear for their lives, only to be caught and ticketed by the police for the offence of disobeying the red light which attracts six demerit points.\"In an interview with The Sunday Gleaner, the straight-talking senior cop said it was unjust for motorists to be ticketed because they are trying to protect their lives and property by not sitting at the stop light in the wee hours of the morning.\"At that time of the morning, I personally believe that it is not fair,\" said Lewis.The top traffic cop also noted that based on the possibility of crimes being committed against motorists at stop lights, he is strongly pushing the proposal.assist policeIn closing his letter, Lewis also argued that the flashing red lights system would assist the police greatly in their crime-fighting efforts.The country's top traffic cop also asked that the matter be treated with urgency.\"We are well aware of the financial constraints of the country, but installation of these flashing red lights should be treated with urgency,\" he said.The Sunday Gleaner has learnt the Davies has endorsed the suggestion.Paula Fletcher, executive director of the National Road Safety Council, said her organisation will have to discuss the proposed anti-crime measure before making a pronouncement.While Fletcher told our news team that she understood the rationale behind the proposed flashing red lights, she cautioned against it being abused.She also put the breaks on the swift implementation of the flashing red light initiative by pointing out that it would take legislative change before the flashing red lights could be introduced.The road-safety boss also said that the proposal must be viewed against the push to implement electronic surveillance designed to catch motorists who are breaking the speed limit and those who are running the red light.tyrone.reid@gleanerjm.comMotorists could be allowed to look and continue through some intersections after hours for safetyProposed locations for the introduction of flashing red lights:Washington Boulevard/Duhaney Drive/Bob Marley BoulevardPortia Simpson Miller SquareMountain View/Old Hope Road/Seaview AvenueShortwood Road/Grants Pen AvenueSouth Camp Road/ Victoria Avenue/Windward RoadMountain View/Windward RoadAll traffic lights downtown Kingston\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4724, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6c7060c0b92f60d4", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:17:31", "title": "Olint money mystery -

The beds are in need of changing so I am not going to deny that; that is a fact. The beds are in need of changing and the mattresses are in need of changing so I am not going to stand here and tell you that it is a perfect situation because the resources are not available,\" said Adams-Thomas.\"Advocate for us that corporate Jamaica will help us as best as possible,\" pleaded Adams-Thomas.The latest budgetary allocation to the home was $160 million but the administrators said that amount just covers the basic needs.The home is currently spending approximately $800,000 per month to run each of its eight clusters but it really needs $1.5 million per cluster to properly provide for the residents.\"We just bought diapers in February and that was close to a million dollars per month for just four clusters. If we got that additional (money) that would help us in not only diapers but in medication as well,\" Donald Gayle, the home's assistant general manager explained as he pointed to some improvements which have taken place since The Sunday Gleaner's expos\u00e9 one year ago.Gayle told our news team that over the past year, the home has been restructured into four clusters for residents who cannot help themselves, and four clusters for those able to manage on their own.This allows the administrators to streamline the care given to each inmate.Another glimmer of hope is that in addition to the two bathrooms having already been improved, two more on Cluster D are slated to be retrofitted during this financial year.addressing foodThe administrators said they are also moving to address the quality and quantity of the food provided for the residents.When our news team returned to the home recently, we saw the two bathrooms on Cluster A which were renovated but pesky flies were still having their way with the mostly congenitally disabled residents on Cluster D.In addition, the controversial practice of placing severely disabled residents on the floor seems to be continuing.During our visit, some of the windows and the doors to the 'baby rooms' - so called because the occupants are not able to help themselves - on Cluster D were closed although it was the visiting hour.Delfreda Cammock Thorpe, operations manager at the home told The Sunday Gleaner that the doors were closed because the residents were receiving their baths.Cammock Thorpe said the patients were on the floor as a precursor to getting a shower.\"As I said to you before, it is tidying time \u0085 and they have to go to the bathroom,\" she explained.However, Adams-Thomas accepted that it is inhumane to have the patients on the naked floor.She argued that it would be difficult to overpower the army of pesky flies.\"It's kind of hard to eradicate the fly situation. This time when it is bathing time and there is the smell of urine, you are going to have a lot of flies coming around.\"According to Adams-Thomas, the swarms of flies, some pitching on the faces of residents who cannot use their hands to fan them away, really descend on the institution in seasons.She asserted that the fly problem was time-factored and only becomes unbearable when the diapers are being changed in the mornings and in the afternoons.The general manager also admitted that the staff level remains inadequate.\"Keep in mind that it was 23 to one because the gap was wide so you can imagine how difficult it was for one staff to 23. Even though we have increased it we are still not (at the required level),\" Adam-Thomas admitted.She said the ideal patient-to-staff ratio for a nursing home like the Golden Age Home should be six to one.\"It was once an assisted-living institution but is (now) more of a nursing institution. We are really trying to see how best we can get there but you know how it is with the money,\" the general manager lamented.It has been more than a year since the shameful conditions were exposed by a Sunday Gleaner investigation, and while the authorities promised an investigation and the implementation of remedial measures, it appears that Adams-Thomas and her slate of administrators seem to have been given a basket to carry water.tyrone.reid@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4726, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/93405beca144c216", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:17:33", "title": "Ja's tax dollars creating jobs in Trinidad", "occurred_at": "2012-05-13 01:38:27", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120513/lead/lead9.html", "data": "More than 1,000 new jobs could be created if school books were printed in JamaicaRyon Jones, Staff ReporterThe Jamaica Manufacturers' Association (JMA) is arguing that more than 1,000 new jobs could be created in no time if the Government institutes measures to revitalise the local print industry.Addressing a recent Gleaner Editors' Forum, immediate past president of the JMA, Omar Azan, chided the Government for failing to concentrate on printing locally.\"The printing industry has guaranteed 1,000 jobs immediately if (local printers) get 30 per cent of the Government's printing jobs,\" declared Azan, who is also the CEO of Boss Furniture Company Limited.\"Our printing industry died because our printing went to Trinidad,\" added Azan.\"Our taxpayers' money that went into the government coffers went straight to Trinidad's printing industry, because they got consistency and volumes of printing.\"They were able to build their printing industry and we, like the idiots in this country, keep sending our money down there and building and employing those people down there.

This, especially, as an informal survey of local pest control experts indicate that 40 per cent had come across the insect in recent times.Bedbugs, which were very common in the United States and United Kingdom at the turn of the 20th century, were driven underground by homeowners and pest control operators coating everything with the insecticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), which would be banned in America because of its lasting impact on the environment. However, by the 1990s bedbugs were making a comeback in the United States, peaking around 2004 when the press picked it up, focusing primarily on the infestation of hotels.In the meantime, the parasites were working their way back into individual homes and now established themselves in multi-unit facilities - apartments, shelters and group homes. The problem is that most people can't afford the time, effort and money to really track down and kill these bloodsuckers. The fact is that getting rid of them is very labour intensive which drives up the eradication cost and some people just can't be bothered, which is a bad thing.Dr Miller explains: \"Consequently, we're developing these reservoirs of bedbugs in these different multi-unit housing communities and people are going to work, kids are going to school and the bedbugs are going with them to all these places.\"As the entomologist pointed out, with the exception of fumigation where the entire building is covered under a massive tent and fumigated for a set period of time, whatever other method is used - including chemical application and heat - will require finding every bedbug and the eggs and killing them. Killing means hitting each insect or egg individually. You can hit them with an insecticide but a hammer would be equally effective.Reducing the spread of this pesky parasite requires alertness and caution.

Divided equally among the 63 MPs, each constituency would benefit from $14.7 million.If approved by Parliament, it would mean that CDF allocation is being cut from $20 million per constituency.Opposition member Daryl Vaz, one proponent of the backbench alliance, told The Gleaner that the cut would reduce the effectiveness of MPs.\"Despite the harsh economic realities, I believe the reduction of $5 million per constituency is a sizeable cut and it will definitely cause dislocation to the activities and functions of the member of parliament in terms of being able to respond, especially in emergency situations,\" Vaz told The Gleaner.hope for lobbyingThe West Portland MP said he hoped that members on both sides would be able to lobby together and have the allocation return to $20 million.\"I heard mutterings after the estimates were tabled and the mutterings that I heard are coming heavily from both sides.

It has not been outrightly rejected but it has been put on the table,\" Jackson said.When the CDF was introduced in the 2008-2009 fiscal year, each MP was given $40 million to spend on projects in their constituency.Jackson said Finance Minister Dr Peter Phillips had indicated that the CDF should not be seen as a stand-alone but in conjunction with other programmes such as the Jamaica Emergency Employment Programme.\"It is a reduction that no one welcomes, but the discussions are in line with looking at it in the context of all other programmes available to MPs in their constituencies,\" Jackson said.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4734, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dd9650834ebe86e1", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:17:42", "title": "Jamaica aims at plastic-recycling programme", "occurred_at": "2012-05-13 01:38:27", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120512/lead/lead61.html", "data": "If all goes well, Jamaica will have an effective national plastic container separation programme by the next financial year.That's the hope of Local Government Minister Noel Arscott, who was speaking at yesterday's launch of the Plastic Container Separation Pilot Project, to be run by the National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA). Arscott read from a 2006 NSWMA study that said over one million tonnes of waste was generated from residential, commercial and industrial institutions, 14 per cent of it plastic. He stressed the benefits of plastic recycling.\"Producing new plastic from recycled material uses two-thirds less energy than making products from virgin raw materials,\" he said. He also noted recycling reduces greenhouse-gas emissions and pointed to the numerous products made from recycled plastic.The three communities chosen for the pilot are Karachi, Havendale and Whitfield Town. Executive director of the NSWMA, Jennifer Edwards, said that the issue of recycling and separation is not new but it was time to learn more.\"We believe that we need to gather that data now to get a feel as to the amount that is out there to be recycled and for the willingness of the citizens to participate in this process,\" she said. Edwards admitted the NSWMA couldn't successfully collect, transport and manage all the waste at the disposal site, at least not without tremendous cost.\"And so the matter of separation is one that is critical and important,\" she said. She explained that residents will separate their plastics from their other waste, the NSWMA will provide the containers and will collect the garbage at designated times. The first pick-up was on Thursday. The areas were selected from a pool of communities that covered the various socio-economic strata. The project is for six months in the first instance, but Arscott noted that it would be moving into other regions, especially targeting schools, where they will teach children how to separate plastic from other solid waste.Edwards explained there will be at least one project in each parish in the western region with one project in the three remaining regions, perhaps in St Ann (north), Manchester (central) and Portland (east).

Anne Shirley, ContributorThe Government of Jamaica tabled an expenditure budget of $612.4 billion in the House of Representatives yesterday. This Budget reflects above-the-line expenditure of $277.72 billion and amortisation payments of $198.17 billion.As in previous years, debt servicing accounts for the largest portion of the Budget. In the upcoming Budget, debt servicing accounts for 54.65 per cent as compared with 46.38 in 2011-12 - an increase of approximately 8.3 per cent. And it is obvious that the current International Monetary Fund negotiations could be drawn out and are requiring a significant increase in debt repayment during this fiscal year, including outstanding debt obligations from the sugar divestment that have been assumed by the Government.AmortisationPerhaps the most significant change in the 2012-13 Estimates of Expenditure is the overall budgeted increase of $70.11 billion in the provisions for the repayment of loans as compared with 2011-12. The Government has earmarked $198.17 billion for amortisation as compared with $128.06 billion repaid in the previous year. The majority of this increase ($57.43 billion) is slated for the repayment of internal loans.a) Repayment of internal loansThe Government has earmarked $124.6 billion to repay internal loans as follows: Provision of $74.98 billion to cover the repayment of Jamaica dollar benchmark notes issued under the Jamaica Debt Exchange (JDX) initiative; A further $26.12 billion has been provided for the repayment of US dollar benchmark notes under the JDX initiative, as well as $8.19 million to repay debt instruments denominated and payable in US$ issued in the local market by the Government; $548 million has been allocated for the provision of the repayment of loans raised through local commercial banks re (i) Sugar Company of Jamaica (SCJ) loans assumed by the Government; and (ii) loans re the acquisition of motor vehicles for the police force; An additional $111.5 million has been provided to repay promissory notes issued to, and loans raised from parastatal bodies including (i) repayment to the Development Bank of Jamaica and PetroCaribe Fund for debt assumed on behalf of the SCJ; (ii) reimbursement of taxes withheld on loan payments due to the National Insurance Fund (NIF) and other NIF investments; and (iii) payment to the National Housing Trust re Stadium Gardens and rehabilitation of barracks at Up Park Camp; And $323.6 million has also been provided to meet principal payments re the invocation of government guarantees to accommodate a loan payment to the DBJ for SCJ Holdings Ltd.b) Repayment of external loansOn the external debt repayment side, the majority of the increase in the allocations is accounted for in an $11.65-billion increase in the contingency allocation for \"the execution of a liability management exercise\". This is the second year in a row that such an allocation has been made in the finance ministry's budget.

So we are hoping that after discussion with the minister, it should now become a part of the whole Labour Day activities,\" she explained.She pointed out that the damage to Donald Sangster's shrine appeared to be the work of vandals.The theme of Workers' Week and Labour Day this year is 'Step Forward - Make Jamaica Beautiful'.Simpson Miller said the theme was a call to action for Jamaicans to unite and step forward boldly to \"make this the best Labour Day ever in celebration of our 50th anniversary\".\"The theme places emphasis on cleaning up (and) beautifying our environment. It will not be possible to honour our heritage without honouring ourselves and cleaning up our country,\" Simpson Miller told scores of officials who attended the launch.'Special place'Commenting on the park, the prime minister said Jamaicans should put work into beautifying National Heroes Park, \"a special place in memory of our national heroes and those who served selflessly this country and our people\".Workers' Week starts on May 20 and Labour Day is May 23.Minister of Youth and Culture Lisa Hanna said many of the public spaces that would host Jamaica 50 celebrations would be cleaned up as part of Labour Day activities.Jamaica is observing the 51st anniversary of Labour Day as a national holiday and the 40th anniversary of Labour Day as a day of voluntary work in communities.A national church service will be held on Sunday, May 20 at the Calvary Baptist Church in Montego Bay in recognition of the historic role played by Baptist churches in the fight against forced labour and the martyrdom of Deacon Samuel Sharpe.edmond.campbell@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4747, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/da10570316faeb1c", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:17:56", "title": "GG talks up JEEP", "occurred_at": "2012-05-11 01:52:45", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120511/lead/lead91.html", "data": "THE GOVERNMENT is pushing to meet its target of creating 5,000 jobs in the first phase of the Jamaica Emergency Employment Programme (JEEP) by next month.Governor General Sir Patrick Allen said the target would be met in June as the JEEP gets into high gear.Sir Patrick was delivering the Throne Speech in Parliament yesterday, ushering in a new legislative year.Short-term employment opportunities to be provided under JEEP include river-training works, repairs to gullies and drains, road repairs and the installation of traffic lights.

In a statement yesterday, the ministry suggested there was an attempt to try the case in the court of public opinion.Noting that it did not normally comment on such issues in public, the ministry said it felt compelled to speak out this time as a result of the number of inaccuracies in statements being made publicly.The ministry said in 2011, the TAJ started a process of auditing various sectors of the economy, including all companies in the telecoms sector.\"Only in this instance, thus far, has the TAJ been forced to resort to the courts to secure the information requested, and only after all other reasonable means of getting the required information had been exhausted,\" the ministry added.No assessment servedThe ministry also said it wished to make clear that, contrary to media reports yesterday, no tax assessment had been served on Digicel as an investigation was currently in progress.According to the statement, the TAJ had, therefore, provided no figures indicating tax owed by the company.In its affidavit filed in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, Digicel stated that the TAJ had asserted that \"for the three-month period under review, there was a J$111 billion (US$1.256 billion) discrepancy in the numbers it had 'calculated' and the amount Digicel had included in its GCT (general consumption tax) returns\".Digicel had argued that \"it is now abundantly clear, however, that TAJ completely misunderstood the data it had been provided with and - rather than seeking clarity - it arrived at its own grossly inaccurate conclusions\".Technical assistanceBut yesterday, the ministry advised that in conducting the sector audits, the Government received significant technical assistance from multilateral agencies. \"We have also secured bilateral assistance from countries with a reputation for having the most competent tax authorities globally.\"Despite the unfortunate and misleading accusations against the TAJ, the exercise to improve tax compliance will continue as we now have irrefutable proof of considerable revenue leakage taking place in Jamaica,\" the ministry declared.The finance authorities said they would refrain from further comment on the issue until the matter was settled in the courts or otherwise.But in a response late yesterday, Digicel contended that at the end of the day, the truth would come out in the court.While the finance ministry adopted a clear stance in support of the TAJ, Minister with Responsibility for Information Sandrea Falconer told journalists at a Jamaica House media briefing yesterday that the Police Commissioner Owen Ellington was probing claims that the police used excessive force during the operation.She stressed that the administration had allowed the leadership of the police force to address that matter.However, Falconer made it clear that the Government would not support heavy-handed tactics.\"Every single Jamaican, or every single company in Jamaica, must be treated in the same way. They must be treated with respect ... ,\"she said.The TAJ has said the sole purpose of its operation at Digicel's offices was to ensure that GCT paid by customers was paid over in full to the tax authorities.\"The operation was done with the support of the police, who acted professionally at all times,\" claimed the TAJ.But Digicel countered, saying it was shocked and offended by the abuse of process and approach undertaken by the TAJ, especially as all information which the state agency was seeking had already been supplied.Late yesterday, the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce (JCC) also joined the debate expressing \"its grave alarm at the procedure employed by the TAJ\" last Friday.It said: \"What is of major concern to the JCC is that the reported procedure employed by the TAJ - including but not limited to the deployment of heavily armed police officers in an operation at the firm's headquarters - sends an extraordinarily objectionable message to our local and international investor community.\"arthur.hall@gleanerjm.com&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4749, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5408e3470a538ed5", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:17:58", "title": "Gov't should do more to support local manufacturers - JMA", "occurred_at": "2012-05-11 01:52:45", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120510/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Livern Barrett, Staff ReporterSome of the leading players in the Jamaican manufacturing sector have blasted sections of the Government's procurement guidelines, charging that those provisions make a mockery of the 'Buy Jamaican' mantra of successive administrations and place local companies at a major disadvantage.The main gripe, according to Metry Seaga, deputy president of the Jamaica Manufacturers' Association (JMA), is with the clause that gives bidders for government furniture contracts 50 per cent of the grade if they can show that they have completed a previous job of a similar standard and size.\"If you haven't done it as a local manufacturer, you can't get it, even if your price is better,\" Seaga said during a Gleaner Editors' Forum held at the newspaper's central Kingston offices yesterday.\"What does that do to local manufacturers?

He was accused of firing at the police when they went in search of his brother, who was wanted by the United States (US) government to face several charges. Christopher was extradited to the US, where he pleaded guilty to assault and racketeering and is now awaiting his sentence.Justice David Fraser, after reviewing the evidence for three days, ruled yesterday that Coke was not guilty.Fraser said he could not rely on the identification evidence adduced by the Crown. The judge described the evidence as unreliable.Nearly two years in custodyAttorneys Carolyn Reid-Cameron and Chukwuemeka Cameron, who were instructed by attorney-at-law Priya Levers, said their client was happy to know that justice had been done. Coke had been in custody since July 2010.He was allegedly beaten this year by soldiers while at the Horizon Adult Remand Centre and has filed a suit in the Supreme Court.Three policemen had testified in the Gun Court that between 11:30 a.m. and midday on May 24, 2010 that they were near the railway line in west Kingston when they were fired on by men - including the accused Coke - who were on McKenzie Drive near to Rasta City in Tivoli Gardens. They said the men were about 30 feet from them at the time of the shooting.In an unsworn statement, Coke said he was not in Tivoli Gardens on the day the police said he fired shots at them. He called a witness who supported his alibi that he was at home for the entire day.Expert witnesses calledThe defence called two expert witnesses, one of whom was a land surveyor, who said he took measurements and prepared a map of the area. He said the distance in relation to the alleged shooting incident was 300 feet and not 30 feet as the policemen testified. The map was tendered in evidence.An ophthalmologist testified that it would be difficult and challenging for a person using the naked eye to identify someone beyond a distance of 120 feet.The judge found that the prosecution did not prove identification in light of the expert witnesses called by the defence. The judge said the police came under heavy gunfire and he believed it would affect their ability to identify Coke.\"The Crown presented the evidence based on what we had. We could not go outside of that,\" Senior Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions Lisa Palmer Hamilton said after the verdict was handed down. She said the prosecution has to respect the judge's verdict. She said the judge relied heavily on the sketch from the land surveyor's report and the opinion of the ophthalmologist.\"The sketch was not shown to the Crown witnesses and they were not present when the distance was measured,\" she added.barbara.gayle@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4752, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d0602d65d224a500", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:18:01", "title": "...

Matalon, indicated yesterday that the controversy surrounding claims that local politicians received donations from collapsed Ponzi scheme Olint could have been avoided if political parties in Jamaica, and those making contributions to them, had been held to a much higher standard in terms of public disclosure of political contributions.At the same time, Professor Trevor Munroe, executive director of the National Integrity Action Limited (NIAL), said the claims in a confiscation order of the Supreme Court of The Turks and Caicos Islands dramatises the urgency for the executive to draft, as a priority, a bill encompassing campaign-finance reform based on the recommendations of the Electoral Commission of Jamaica (ECJ).Give JA timelineNews surfaced Monday afternoon that the Supreme Court in The Turks and Caicos Islands had issued the confiscation order to recover money that convicted operator of the Ponzi scheme, David Smith, gave to the Jamaica Labour Party and the ruling People's National Party in the run-up to the 2007 general election.The PSOJ head urged the administration and Parliament to provide the country with some kind of timeline addressing when a bill on campaign financing would be tabled in Parliament and debated by the legislature.Matalon told The Gleaner the crafting and passage of the proposed law should be done expeditiously \"as a commitment by our political leadership on both sides of the aisle to transparency and probity in our elections\".He said the ECJ has the full backing of the PSOJ of its recommendations dealing with campaign-finance reform.Urging swift action on the part of the legislature, Munroe reminded Leader of Government Business in the House of Representatives Phillip Paulwell to fulfil his commitment to piloting the bill through Parliament by the end of 2012.\"These things can come off the radar screen, especially when there is a legislation programme averaging between 112 and 120 items per year and a Parliament which is meeting an average of 40 afternoons per year. It's easy for it to slip between the cracks, even with the best will in the world,\" the NIAL head told The Gleaner.Emphasising the urgency of crafting and passing campaign-finance laws, Munroe questioned whether big donors to either political party might have sought special favours in return for their donations.Head of the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce, Milton Samuda, said the pressure brought to bear on Government, especially the previous administration, by his organisation, had resulted in some measure of urgency on the part of the Parliament on the matter of campaign-finance reform.He cautioned, however, that while parliamentarians raised relevant points about the ECJ's recommendations, the consideration of those concerns should not result in the \"undue delay in the adoption of measures\".edmond.campbell@gleanerjm.com&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4760, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/297aea35b45ef822", "created_at": "2012-05-11 19:18:08", "title": "Manufacturers' group outraged at tax department's raid on Digicel", "occurred_at": "2012-05-11 01:52:45", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120509/lead/lead2.html", "data": "THE LEADERSHIP of the Jamaica Manufacturers' Association (JMA) has described as \"reprehensible\" the treatment meted out to local telecommunications firm Digicel by the Tax Administration of Jamaica (TAJ).

They have completely refurbished the office building, two gazebos in the lower section, and are about to install tree labels and direction signs.Looking for helpFor Ramdon the intervention is much appreciated but he opines that more needs to be done to keep the facility well kept and attractive to visitors as it is open to the public every day, including public holidays.He told The Gleaner: \"We are still looking for help because right now there are about six entry points and two that are without gates, and it's a challenge because the garden's opening hours are fixed, but even when the garden is closed, we can still see people walking in and out.\"In the past, funding agencies have rejected funding requests, insisting that management must first show how it plans to maintain the grounds and its facilities after rehabilitation. Entry to the gardens has been free since it opened in November 1962, but today's harsh financial realities could result in an entrance fee being charged.Random explained: \"The thinking is that Government cannot provide these facilities for free and we have to try to earn our keep. So for groups, we should charge some amount of fee, particularly those who are coming to have picnics where they occupy a space, a gazebo, or so. However, for the regular persons who are coming as a family, it would essentially still be free for the time being.

Among the others are the lack of resources and the limited classroom space.The one-apartment building, which is merely separated by a small blackboard and a table, makes it easy for students to be distracted by lessons taught in the other classes.The school meets its own challenges with parents' inability to pay the school fee of $2,300 and $80 per day for lunch.Principal of the institution, Venneta Black, said with the school only able to collect 25 per cent of the school fees from the 57 students on roll, coupled with the lack of adequate sponsorship, the school is struggling with finances significantly.\"We are having problems collecting the school fees and that is what we get paid from, so it is rough. Sometimes I have to pay them and do without,\" Black told The Gleaner during a recent visit to the school.\"We are having problems because now we are in need of funds to finish the process to get back electricity in the building and we can't find it,\" she lamented.\"The inspector from JPS came here and he said he can't pass the building until everything is done, but we don't have all the money yet.\"Hard to controlThe group of three-year-olds proved to be the ones hardest to control as the teacher struggled to get them to participate in class activities using building blocks.As the teacher, Jodyann Dixon, attended to one table, the others were attending to their own business.It didn't end without a fight and the students were quickly reprimanded; and the class was back to business.\"I have to supervise one group and then another so that they will all get a chance to be involved, but it is not possible to do all of them at the same time,\" she added.Dixon is sometimes forced to take her class near the window, which is more conducive for learning.\"They are not affected by the heat when they are at the window and I have to let them sit on the floor so that I can go down to their level,\" she said.The teachers placed emphasis on reading along with the use of crayons and play dough to create drawings of what is being taught.For the nine students in class three, it was a walkover to speak about Jamaica as they looked at the theme 'Jamaica Land We Love, the Beauty of Our Land' which is in keeping with Jamaica's 50th Independence celebration.Sheryl-Ann Clarke, teacher of grade two, said it was not an easy task to cope with some students who were behind in their classwork due to their constant absence from school.\"The challenge is when the parents stop the children from school for a while and they come back and you are trying to help them to reach the level the other students are at and then they stop again. It really affects them,\" she explained.The limited staff had left the principal with no option but to multitask to get things done.She acted as the principal by overseeing the day's activities, being a teacher for class three, and rushing to the kitchen to ensure the meal was prepared for the students by lunchtime.She boasted about the students' performances saying they are working at their required level.\"They are doing good at this time, especially the five-year-olds, because we are getting them ready for primary schools now and to this point they are ready,\" she said.She said, however, the school is not fully up to date with the Early Childhood Commission.\"We are lagging behind with the records because most of the parents don't come in as yet with birth certificate and passport-size photos but we have to keep pressuring them,\" she further said.The school is also without a trained teacher at diploma or degree level, but Black said the teachers who are trained up to level two in the National Council on Technical and Vocational Education and Training are competent enough to care for the kids.nadisha.hunter@gleanerjm.com&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4848, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ebf643396b3a04ff", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:43:56", "title": "Visitor arrivals trend up", "occurred_at": "2012-05-05 03:45:16", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120504/lead/lead7.html", "data": "Janet Silvera, Senior Gleaner WriterWESTERN BUREAU:Jamaica's visitor arrivals grew by 19.9 per cent between December 15 and April 15, but the country still faces the challenge of airlift, says Tourism Minister Dr Wykeham McNeill.Addressing members of the media during a press briefing yesterday morning at the Ministry of Tourism in Kingston, McNeill said cruise shipping enjoyed double-digit growth, while land-based saw an increase of one per cent.Statistics presented by the minister showed the country welcoming some 1.35 million visitors in total -

Partly as a result of these sales, the bank\u2019s gross reserves at the end of March 2012 amounted to US$2,638.9 million, representing 17 weeks of projected goods and services imports,\u201d he noted.&#13;\n\r\n\tMr. Wynter further stated that during the review quarter, there were also concerns about the volatility of international commodity prices, particularly that of crude oil. He explained that it was against the background of the uncertainties that the bank maintained its monetary policy rate at 6.25 per cent for the March quarter.&#13;\n\r\n\tWith respect to the broader picture, Mr. Wynter informed that the performance of the main macro-economic indicators was largely favourable in the March 2012 quarter.&#13;\n\r\n\t\u201cInflation was 1.7 per cent for the review quarter, within the bank\u2019s forecast range, which contributed to inflation of 7.3 per cent for the fiscal year, also within the range expected for the year. The foreign exchange market was also relatively stable with the weighted average selling rate of the US Dollar vis-\u00e0-vis the Jamaica Dollar depreciating by 0.8 per cent for the quarter and 1.8 per cent for 2011/12 financial year,\u201d he informed.&#13;\n\r\n\tIn addition, the estimates of the Bank suggest that \u201cthe nascent recovery in economic activity\u201d continued in the review quarter and resulted in the expansion for the fiscal year being also within the forecast range of 1.0 per cent to 2.0 per cent, the Governor said.&#13;\n\r\n\t\u201cOf note, the up-tick in credit to the private sector which was observed in the December 2011 quarter continued into the March 2012 quarter. The increased demand for private sector loans could be reflective of the continued decline in commercial bank loan rates as depicted in the fall of 35 basis points in the weighted average rate of interest on private sector credit,\u201d he stated.&#13;\n\r\n\tThe Governor also cited the marginal improvement in the quality of private sector credit with the ratio of non-performing loans, three-months and over, declining to 8.4 per cent at end-March 2012, from 8.8 per cent at end-December 2011.&#13;\n\r\n\tIn addition, during the March 2012 quarter, market-determined interest rates remained broadly stable in the regular auctions of 30, 90 and 180-day Government of Jamaica (GOJ) Treasury Bills.&#13;\n\r\n\tAs examples of the stability, the Central Bank Governor stated that the average yield on the 180-day Treasury Bill was 6.47 per cent at the March auction, compared to 6.46 per cent at the auction last December.&#13;\n\r\n\t\u00a0&#13;\n\r\n\tBy Allan Brooks, JIS Senior Reporter&#13;\n        ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4793, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "http://www.jis.gov.jm/news/list/30537", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:33:56", "title": "BoJ Projects 6-8 Per Cent Inflation for 2012/13  - May 11, 2012 (Fri)", "occurred_at": "2012-05-11 20:33:56", "source": 7, "link": "http://www.jis.gov.jm/news/list/30537", "data": "\nThe Bank of Jamaica is projecting that headline inflation will be within the range of 6.0 per cent to 8.0 per cent for 2012/13 financial year, largely similar to the previous fiscal year\u2019s out-turn.&#13;\n\r\n\tThis was disclosed by Governor of the Bank of Jamaica (BoJ), Brian Wynter, during his presentation of the Central Bank\u2019s report for the January to March, 2012 quarter.&#13;\n\r\n\tWith respect to the inflation forecast for the June, 2012 quarter, the projection is that it will be in the range of 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. This follows the out-turn of 1.7 per cent for the March 2012 quarter, which was within the forecast range of 1.0 per cent to 2.0 per cent.&#13;\n\r\n\tHowever, the Central Bank Governor cautioned that the current forecast \u201cassumes that imported inflation, domestic inflation expectations and capacity conditions will be relatively stable during the quarter.\"&#13;\n\r\n\tMeanwhile, the inflation forecast for the entire financial year is underpinned by assumptions which include, \u201cgenerally favourable weather patterns, both in Jamaica and the major grain producing countries, and a moderate increase in the price of crude oil, given the projection for continued growth in the global economy,\u201d Mr. Wynter said.&#13;\n\r\n\tHowever, Governor Wynter pointed to \u201csignificant upside risks to the forecast for inflation, for both the current quarter and the fiscal year.\u201d&#13;\n\r\n\tThe primary risk, the Governor said, relates to the measures that may be announced in the \u201cimminent budget presentation to set the fiscal accounts and debt dynamics on a sustainable path for the medium term.\"&#13;\n\r\n\tHe observed that these measures could result in \u201cinflation exceeding the upper bound of the forecast range for both the June quarter and the fiscal year. This could be exacerbated by higher-than-anticipated oil prices if there is a resurgence in geopolitical tensions and growth in the world economy is stronger than is currently being projected.\u201d&#13;\n\r\n\tWith respect to \u201creal GDP growth\u201d the Bank of Jamaica projects continued slow growth of domestic output for the June 2012 quarter, largely similar to the estimated expansion for the March 2012 quarter.&#13;\n\r\n\t\u201cAgriculture, Forestry &amp; Fishing continues to be the major drivers of growth and is expected to be supported by expansion in Mining &amp; Quarrying, Hotels &amp; Restaurants and Electricity &amp; Water Supply,\u201d he said.&#13;\n\r\n\tFor the 2012/13 financial year, economic output is projected to grow marginally in the range of 0.0 per cent to 1.0 per cent. The current outlook reflects the expectation of continued weak domestic demand, albeit improving relative to the crisis period, and a slower pace of expansion in world growth in calendar year 2012, relative to 2011.&#13;\n\r\n\tIn spite of the forecast for a slowdown in world growth in 2012 relative to 2011, the Central Bank anticipates that with the steady recovery in the US economy, there will be an increase in external demand for Jamaica\u2019s goods and services as well as acceleration in remittance flows to Jamaica.&#13;\n\r\n\tAccording to the Central Bank, \u201cupside risks\u201d to the growth forecast include the impact on growth and employment of major investment projects later in the fiscal year. However, the risks to the growth forecast at this time are largely to the \u201cdownside,\u201d primarily the uncertainty regarding the extent of the fiscal consolidation to be announced.&#13;\n\r\n\t\u201cFiscal consolidation would result in reduced domestic demand in the near-term, which could be exacerbated by weaker global growth and the impact of adverse weather,\u201d he observed.&#13;\n\r\n\tHowever, the Bank is forecasting that should the fiscal measures materialise, the adverse impact on growth will be temporary.&#13;\n\r\n\t\u201cInflation, after the initial impact of potential fiscal measures, is expected to decelerate over the medium term towards the rate of inflation of our major trading partners. Additionally, economic growth should pick up in 2013/14 financial year and strengthen in the subsequent years, consistent with the forecast for expansion in the world economy, the successful implementation of a number of foreign direct investment projects and the re-opening of two alumina plants,\u201d Mr. Wynter argued.&#13;\n\r\n\t\u00a0&#13;\n\r\n\tBy Allan Brooks, JIS Senior Reporter&#13;\n        ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4794, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "http://www.jis.gov.jm/news/list/30536", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:33:57", "title": "Govt.

The total amount of contribution/donation given by a donor shall not exceed in a single campaign period an amount of $1 million to a single candidate, or an amount of $1 million multiplied by the number of constituencies being contested by a political party, provided that the total amount given to all candidates and all political parties does not exceed $10,000,000.2. Any contribution/donation that is made by a permissible donor shall be regarded as a tax-deductible expense.3. Any contribution/donation made by a donor must be accompanied by a declaration to the candidate or political party stating the full name, address, occupation or nature of business and that the donor qualifies to make a donation under the regulations. A person, whether legal or natural, who knowingly, or recklessly, makes a false declaration commits an offence.4.

Where in relation to a political party or a candidate -\t(a) money is lent otherwise than on commercial terms; or\t(b) any property, services or facilities are provided otherwise than on commercial terms, the value of the donation shall be taken to be the amount representing the difference between the actual cost and the cost that would have been incurred by the political party, or the candidate, as the case may be, had the loan been made, or the property, services or facilities been provided on commercial terms.10. Where a contribution/ donation is received by a political party, or a candidate, and it is not immediately clear that the political party should refuse the contribution/donation, all reasonable steps shall be taken without delay by, or on behalf of, the political party or candidate to verify or ascertain -\t(a) the identity of the donor;\t(b) whether the donor is a permissible donor; and\t(c ) if the donor is a permissible donor, all such details in respect of the donor as may be required by the Electoral Commission to be received and given in respect of the donor in the donation report.11.

Upon receipt of a contribution/donation report and declaration the Electoral Commission shall no later than 21 days issue the candidate concerned with a certificate stating that the person has complied.17.

Matalon, indicated yesterday that the controversy surrounding claims that local politicians received donations from collapsed Ponzi scheme Olint could have been avoided if political parties in Jamaica, and those making contributions to them, had been held to a much higher standard in terms of public disclosure of political contributions.At the same time, Professor Trevor Munroe, executive director of the National Integrity Action Limited (NIAL), said the claims in a confiscation order of the Supreme Court of The Turks and Caicos Islands dramatises the urgency for the executive to draft, as a priority, a bill encompassing campaign-finance reform based on the recommendations of the Electoral Commission of Jamaica (ECJ).Give JA timelineNews surfaced Monday afternoon that the Supreme Court in The Turks and Caicos Islands had issued the confiscation order to recover money that convicted operator of the Ponzi scheme, David Smith, gave to the Jamaica Labour Party and the ruling People's National Party in the run-up to the 2007 general election.The PSOJ head urged the administration and Parliament to provide the country with some kind of timeline addressing when a bill on campaign financing would be tabled in Parliament and debated by the legislature.Matalon told The Gleaner the crafting and passage of the proposed law should be done expeditiously \"as a commitment by our political leadership on both sides of the aisle to transparency and probity in our elections\".He said the ECJ has the full backing of the PSOJ of its recommendations dealing with campaign-finance reform.Urging swift action on the part of the legislature, Munroe reminded Leader of Government Business in the House of Representatives Phillip Paulwell to fulfil his commitment to piloting the bill through Parliament by the end of 2012.\"These things can come off the radar screen, especially when there is a legislation programme averaging between 112 and 120 items per year and a Parliament which is meeting an average of 40 afternoons per year. It's easy for it to slip between the cracks, even with the best will in the world,\" the NIAL head told The Gleaner.Emphasising the urgency of crafting and passing campaign-finance laws, Munroe questioned whether big donors to either political party might have sought special favours in return for their donations.Head of the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce, Milton Samuda, said the pressure brought to bear on Government, especially the previous administration, by his organisation, had resulted in some measure of urgency on the part of the Parliament on the matter of campaign-finance reform.He cautioned, however, that while parliamentarians raised relevant points about the ECJ's recommendations, the consideration of those concerns should not result in the \"undue delay in the adoption of measures\".edmond.campbell@gleanerjm.com&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4809, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ff89231b790aead8", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:43:25", "title": "Court finds Mavado guilty...fined $100,000 or six months in prison", "occurred_at": "2012-05-09 08:53:26", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120508/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Christopher Thomas, Gleaner WriterWESTERN BUREAU:Almost a year after he was arrested for assaulting a St James man and his son and damaging their car in an apparent case of road rage, dancehall star David 'Mavado' Brooks was yesterday found guilty in the Montego Bay Resident Magistrate's Court.Brooks, who was facing charges of assault occasioning bodily harm and malicious destruction of property, hung his head as Resident Magistrate Wilson Smith handed down the verdict.Brooks was fined $80,000 or a six-month prison term on the assault charge, and $20,000 or six months' imprisonment on the malicious destruction charge. The sentences are to run concurrently if the fines are not paid.\"I hope today will be a turning point in your life, where you will think not once, not twice, but more times before acting,\" Smith told the deejay, while passing the sentence.Brooks' attorney, Martyn Thomas, pointed out to the court that his client accepted the ruling and was remorseful for the events that led to him being arrested and charged.\"Having found him guilty, I'd like to urge upon you that the accused man has accepted the finding of the court and is willing to move on,\" Thomas said.Brooks, who hails from West Armour Heights in St Andrew, was charged in connection with an incident on July 22, 2011, in which he and members of his entourage allegedly attacked the complainants - Henry Cunningham and his son, Oshane - and damaged their car along the Belmont main road in St James.Following Monday's verdict, Brooks was escorted from the courtroom by police officers to an adjoining holding area, where he was expected to remain until the fines were paid.Could face suitIn the meantime, the Cunninghams may now pursue civil action against the deejay for damages from the July 22 incident, should they so choose.

The constable was injured in the incident.Shot at point-blank rangeThe police said that in another incident, during an attempt to apprehend members of the Hunk of Gold gang, a policeman was shot at point-blank range. He was saved by his ballistic vest. It also pointed to another incident in Riverton City, St Andrew, on Saturday where policemen responding to a murder came under attack while trying to transport one of the injured persons involved in the incident to hospital.Though the police did not outline exactly how they had used  restraint in these incidents, Bunting, responding to the news, said he, too, was encouraged, adding that this might be the beginning of a culture change. The minister said, however, that the police must be careful that criminals \"don't take kindness for weakness and become more brazen in attacking policemen\". He said: \"I also understand the balance that the High Command has to be trying to achieve. In a sense, it's almost like walking between raindrops because we are not yet at the stage where we have eliminated high-powered weapons from criminal gangs out there and, therefore, it is a dangerous policing environment.\" In March, Bunting called for police to make every effort to preserve the lives of suspects and innocent bystanders, even when engaged in shoot-outs. \"We are not putting even the lives of gunmen confronting the police at a lower level. If they can be saved, they should be saved as well.\" New strategies coming Bunting said the police should engage in the use of deadly force \"only if it is unavoidable and necessary to protect innocent lives\". Police Commissioner Owen Ellington later announced that the police would be adopting several new strategies regarding the use of force which are intended to lessen the number of fatal incidents during operations. He said the new approach is to be incorporated into the police's standard operating procedures, as well as included in the firearm and tactical training for top-ranked officers.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4820, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7ecfd9ded556e2ac", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:43:33", "title": "Candles lit for children lost", "occurred_at": "2012-05-07 04:25:16", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120507/lead/lead2.html", "data": "A picture of despair was etched on the faces of many who gathered at the intersection of Church and Tower streets in downtown Kingston yesterday evening to light candles and honour the memory of children who died violently or otherwise tragically over the years.It was a familiar event for many who have been making the journey to the crying monument every year to light candles and reflect, but the emotion is one that many have just not got used to.\"Come mek me show you Crissy name,\" Doreen Raymond, a resident of Torrington Park in Kingston, told her nine-year-old nephew as the two drew close to the monument.House firebombedThe nine-year-old boy and Crissy were friends growing up in the Torrington Park community until she was killed tragically when gunmen firebombed her house.Her mother was also killed in the incident, which was considered an act of reprisal.\"She was a bright student at Clan Carthy Primary at the time.

Jesus Christ\".\"My early relationship with my dad was ... acrimonious, it was damaging, it was ... .\"Levy's voice trails off as he feels for words. \"Things really didn't start coming together until I first recognised my dad's authority as a father.\" 'What about now?' \"Well now (the boyish grin and animation return), now he's my confidant, my adviser, my ... my best friend.\" Levy gushes as he is being interviewed at All Media Studios in New Kingston.Levy wears his heart on his sleeve when it comes to talking about Jamaica Broilers, his relationships and his deep Christian beliefs. Left to talk long enough and he will evangelise on any of those topics. That is not hard to understand as his whole teenage and adult life has been shaped by those associations.Good experienceAt age 13, working during the summer, his job was to vacuum-clean chicken dander (fine hair from hatchlings) from all the machines in the Jamaica Broilers hatchery.\"By the time I was finished, I'd be totally covered in the stuff,\" he recalls. \"Then I had to turn around and hose down the place and make it spic and span.\"That was good experience because throughout his 30-odd-year formal association with Jamaica Broilers, Levy has had to learn all aspects of the business from sales and marketing to meat processing to feed milling.\"That has helped me in my present role because I have an appreciation of what it takes to get the job done,\" he said.The all-round experience coupled with a solid education (from Munro to Harvard Business School) pretty much defines Christopher Levy. Once he got settled from being the \"arrogant\" handful of a young man, Chris became impatient.\"I was in a big hurry to get school out of the way. I really wanted to work ... . I wanted to apply myself.\"Sure enough, Chris Levy finished a two-year master's programme in one year.\"The Harvard experience was good though. I got to sit with some very smart people.\"The other part of the development of Christopher came through what he saw in businessman R. Danny Williams.\"If I'm to say there is somebody I really look at and admire and be inspired by, I'd say it's him ... and my dad of course.\"All of those influences have come to bear on Chris Levy's leadership credo, \"I'm all for inclusiveness but at the same time decisiveness, there is no time for analysis paralysis.\"At the heart of his leadership style is people. \"We have to consider how our decisions will impact families. That's true for your workers or contract farmers or other stakeholders ... people's lives are important. When we do that, it benefits everybody.\"The perfect planWhile being at the top of a successful company and having made the right moves, Chris Levy ponders only for a moment what he could have done differently.\"Yeah, I sometimes wonder if it would have been different if I really settled down ... y'know ... held it together earlier in life ... but I never question the Master (Jesus). He brings order to life. He has the perfect plan.\"Earlier, Levy had related the story of a local business school student who had come to interview him about leadership.\"She was really asking all the right questions ... very bright and she asked me about the culture at Jamaica Broilers. That one stopped me for a minute and I just turned around and took up a book off the shelf and put it down before her and said, 'All our company's culture and values are in that book, the Bible'.\"There is one thing to be sure of when talking with Chris Levy.

He had served at the Police Training School, St Andrew Central Division, Professional Standards Branch and Anti-Corruption Branch.In a release yesterday, the Police High Command expressed regret at the passing of the two senior members of the organisation.\"The High Command is reassuring the families of both police officers of our full support, counsel and prayers during this difficult time, and also wishes to offer a special word of comfort to the colleagues at the Protective Services and Clarendon divisions,\" the release read.Minister of National Security Peter Bunting also expressed sadness at the deaths of the two members of the force.He said Henry was described by both his colleagues in the High Command and the Clarendon community as \"one of the very best\" policemen.Bunting hailed Henry's achievements, citing the significant reduction in major crimes over the period.The minister said Grant was well known and liked by ministers and parliamentarians for his friendly, cooperative and professional approach.He said he received a number of commendations during his long tenure in the JCF.nadisha.hunter@gleanerjm.com\u00a0\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4823, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8394429ddf4556b7", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:43:35", "title": "Fire leaves four families homeless", "occurred_at": "2012-05-07 04:25:16", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120507/lead/lead5.html", "data": "Four families, including nine children, are without a home following a fire at Carnarvon Street in Vineyard Town, Kingston, yesterday morning.Reports from the Rollington Town Fire Department are that the fire started close to 11 a.m.Lost everythingDonavan Campbell, one occupant, told The Gleaner he lost everything in the fire.\"Mi no know what to do.

More than a dozen people were hard at work. Most noticeable, however, were three men, with machete in hand, who appeared to be catching their breaths; and two women who appeared to be playing an overseeing role.There was also the case of a one-armed hand man at the site, with an umbrella in hand, and an orange cap with the marking PETER on it.The cap was identical to those worn by supporters of Dr Peter Phillips, a senior member of the governing People's National Party.The Gleaner was unable to ascertain whether the man was among the persons employed under JEEP.Member of parliament (MP) for North Central St Catherine, Natalie Neita-Headley, told The Gleaner that she was not aware of the man either being from her constituency or being employed on the project.\"He is probably a passer-by,\" she said, while adding that workers were told that no party colours must be worn on the JEEP projects.\"It is very difficult to monitor. Unless you are on the site every day to monitor whether people wear an armband, cap or T-shirt,\" she said.The MP, meanwhile, said drain cleaning at Bamboo Corner was important, especially with the hurricane season approaching.\"When we can't find the funds to clean it, we have a problem,\" Neita-Headley said, while adding that flooding often results in the roadway rendered impassable.Yvonne Sutherland, one of the JEEP passengers at Bamboo Corner, told The Gleaner that 23 people are working on that leg of the project doing drain cleaning and bushing. She said people are to get about three days' work.Labourers on JEEP projects earn approximately $1,500 per day.\"Di work nuh long but mi born come hear my grandmother say constant drops better than heavy showers,\" Sutherland told The Gleaner.\"For a man to have nothing doing and he gets three days' work, him must eat food.

While it is not the most politically expedient thing to do, The Gavel is convinced that further subsidies cannot be the way forward.Indeed, it is our view that the State has a role in public transportation. But the involvement of the State does not have to be the provision of this service. Vision 2030, the blueprint to take Jamaica to develop-country status, notes that the transport sector represents a critical component of any country in its impact on national development.\"One of the most fundamental attributes of the sector is the ability to move persons, goods and services between spatial locations at the local, regional and international levels. The efficient management of the sector can provide tremendous economic and social gains to a country through indirect and direct employment as well as induced development which ultimately leads to wealth creation and growth,\" says Vision 2030.The role of the stateWe agree with the statement, even as we contend that Government need not be bus operators. The role of the State must be limited to regulating the transport system to ensure reliable, safe and affordable service.When the JUTC was launched in 1998, among its aims was to bring order and civility to the way in which people travel in the Corporate Area. The JUTC, we believe, has fulfilled its mission of eradicating the sardine-tin type, mouldy environment. That comfort has come at a high price to the Jamaican taxpayers, many of whom do not use the service.It is also the view of The Gavel that public transportation is an unfair use of tax resources. Why should the people in rural Jamaica, whose taxes are used to subsidise the JUTC, not get the constant benefit of the JUTC like those in the Corporate Area?Why should children, pensioners and the disabled in the Corporate Area benefit from concessionary fares in air-conditioned buses while those in rural areas have to pay full fare.The transport-sector proposal, which was prepared in 2009, speaks to the development of a long-term plan for the islandwide public-transport system, including for schools. This plan was to be implemented in one to three years. And alarmingly, the plan appears to be built on the back of subsidies.The plan calls for the development of sustainable funding mechanisms for the public-transport system in up to nine years. It is our position that the country should not seek to grow its debt stock to provide a service which can be produced by private players in the market. The proposal should not be encouraged.Not a moral hazardIt is our view that divesting the JUTC and charging private individuals and companies to perform its function in the Kingston Metropolitan Transport Region should not be a moral hazard to the State, if the regulations governing the operation of public transportation are dispassionately and fearlessly applied.And the State need not wait until it divests the JUTC before it starts to impose the regulations. The gains in the public-transport system risk being eroded if the transport authority and the police fail to take appropriate actions against operators who blast sound systems in heavily tinted vehicles.The Parliament should consider amending the regulations to make certain infractions, such as the presence of music boxes in buses, be punishable with the immediate revocation of one's road licence. The practice of having music on the buses must be stopped. If the State fails to properly enforce the law in this area, we fear it will not be able to effectively regulate the entire transport system.In the meantime, we should not assume that because the service is being provided by private players then the people would be charged ridiculous fares.The minister, after being advised by the Office of Utilities Regulation, will still reserve the right to grant fare increases, thereby protecting the public's interest.The State should also consider a review of the licence-issuing regime, which would, among other things, take into consideration the optimum number of operators for the various routes. And to effectively police the system, we propose that the number of transport- authority inspectors be increased and that they be given powers of special district constables.The Gavel has no doubt that Jamaican taxpayers would significantly benefit from our suggestion to not only disband the JUTC but to take steps to ensure commuters travel in style and comfort, while getting to their destination on time and at a reasonable price.BUDGET DEBATE SCHEDULE  May 24 - Opening of Budget Debate - Finance Minister Dr Peter \t\tPhillips May 29 - Opposition Spokesman on Finance Audley Shaw May 30 - Roger Clarke (Government) Opposition member \t\t\tunnamed May 31 - Leader of the Opposition Andrew Holness June 5 - Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller June 6 - Closing of debate  -  Finance Minister Dr Phillips\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4827, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4566f977e39fefcb", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:43:38", "title": "Breach at NHT?

The constable was injured in the incident.Shot at point-blank rangeThe police said that in another incident, during an attempt to apprehend members of the Hunk of Gold gang, a policeman was shot at point-blank range. He was saved by his ballistic vest. It also pointed to another incident in Riverton City, St Andrew, on Saturday where policemen responding to a murder came under attack while trying to transport one of the injured persons involved in the incident to hospital.Though the police did not outline exactly how they had used  restraint in these incidents, Bunting, responding to the news, said he, too, was encouraged, adding that this might be the beginning of a culture change. The minister said, however, that the police must be careful that criminals \"don't take kindness for weakness and become more brazen in attacking policemen\". He said: \"I also understand the balance that the High Command has to be trying to achieve. In a sense, it's almost like walking between raindrops because we are not yet at the stage where we have eliminated high-powered weapons from criminal gangs out there and, therefore, it is a dangerous policing environment.\" In March, Bunting called for police to make every effort to preserve the lives of suspects and innocent bystanders, even when engaged in shoot-outs. \"We are not putting even the lives of gunmen confronting the police at a lower level. If they can be saved, they should be saved as well.\" New strategies coming Bunting said the police should engage in the use of deadly force \"only if it is unavoidable and necessary to protect innocent lives\". Police Commissioner Owen Ellington later announced that the police would be adopting several new strategies regarding the use of force which are intended to lessen the number of fatal incidents during operations. He said the new approach is to be incorporated into the police's standard operating procedures, as well as included in the firearm and tactical training for top-ranked officers.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4828, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/85504ae95bb379f3", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:43:39", "title": "Abortion for sale - Black market thrives on baby-killing pills", "occurred_at": "2012-05-07 04:25:16", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120506/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Some local health professionals, including a radiographer employed to a public hospital, are illegally selling a powerful ulcer treatment drug to persons wanting to have an abortion.The health practitioners, who sell the pills to be misused as a baby killer, fail to warn the buyers that the use of the drug can cause death.The drug - Cytotec (Misoprostol) - is prescribed by some doctors to treat serious stomach ulcers and should not be dispensed by a pharmacist without a prescription.Yet, it is being distributed on the black market for between $6,000 and $7,000 without a prescription and is available to anyone.\n\nIn fact, the government-employed radiographer advertises the 'abortion' pill via BlackBerry Messenger.\"Pregnant and afraid? Can't afford it? Not sure of the father? Don't put your future in limbo ... Get rid of it ... Abortion pills available ... $6,000 one-time cost,\" reads a section of a broadcast message he sent out as he asked contacts to spread the word.\"Please rebroadcast,\" he asked as he peddled his illegal practice.One reporter, posing as a pregnant university student, contacted the radiographer for the pills and after haggling, he agreed to sell her five pills for $4,500.Asked if he was sure the pills would work, the health professional said: \"The pill is good. All you need to do is swallow two and insert three.\"The government-paid health professional also bragged that he had helped to terminate many pregnancies. \"Mi kill whole heap a belly,\" he said.\"A something me do all the time. How you fi ask me if it work,\" he questioned.\"No worry yourself, if you are not more than three months (pregnant) you're good. Sure, sure it a go work,\" he assured.The radiographer also named three locations, including established pharmacies in western Jamaica, where he said the pills could be bought without a prescription.Using \nhis information and word on the street, a Sunday Gleaner \nteam last week visited a pharmacy in downtown Kingston where \nwe were able to purchase the pills without a \nprescription.Getting direction to the establishment \nselling the tablets was easy.A man standing on a \ncorner in the heart of downtown; a vendor selling on the sidewalk, and \none of a group of four schoolgirls provided \ndirections.The drug was provided after a request was \nmade for the abortion pill. The person seeking the pill was told that it\n cost $5,000 with a prescription, but $7,000 \nwithout.After the money changed hands, the pills were\n dispensed in a brown envelope with ominous handwritten \ninstructions.Verbal instructions were also \nprovided.\"The best time to use the tablet is in the \nevening about half-hour after the person has eaten. Ingest two, and \ninsert three, high into the vagina, one after the other,\" the pharmacist\n advised the reporter.Continuing, the pharmacist \nsaid: \"Make sure she is lying on her back, and she has to stay in that \nposition until half-hour time. Do not urinate, do not pass any stool, \nbecause the tablets may fall out.\"No risks \noutlinedBut the pharmacist made no mention of the \nrisk that the pills could pose for the woman or the unborn \nchild.General practitioner Dr Romayne Edwards later \ntold The Sunday Gleaner that a pregnant woman who \nwants to keep her child would not be prescribed this drug if she was \ndiagnosed with an ulcer problem.Dr Edwards warned of \nthe risks women face by taking this pill for an \nabortion.\"Persons can die from the improper use of \nthis medication. But the problems come when the foetus is in the wrong \nplace,\" said Dr Edwards.She added that it is \nextremely dangerous for women with ectopic pregnancies, as when taken \nfor its abortive properties, the pill could give a false sense that \ntermination was under way.\"If it is being used for \nits abortive properties, it should not be used outside of the first \ntrimester of pregnancy. And when used improperly and unsupervised for \nabortions, it can result in haemorrhage (bleeding out) and can prove \nfatal with sufficient blood loss to cause death,\" Dr Edwards \nsaid.\"I get cases here after failed attempts to abort\n and they are suffering from infection. After that, Dr Horace Fletcher \nand his team have to try to help them from losing their uterus,\" she \nexplained.She was supported by Dr Fletcher, who noted\n that the use of the pill for termination of pregnancies is \nillegal.But according to Dr Fletcher, there has been \none positive side effect.Fewer septic \nabortionsHe said the use of the drug has resulted in a\n decrease of septic abortions, as well as the perforation of the uterus \ncaused when doctors are unskilled in the termination of pregnancies \nparticularly when the pregnancy is too big.\"With the \nillegal use of Misoprostol by people, they are terminating pregnancies \non their own and not going to unscrupulous persons who would insert all \nkinds of unclean objects in them which results in sepsis and puts them \nin danger,\" Dr Fletcher said.\"It is not safe to use \nit on your own. But it is safer than what used to obtain in the past,\" \nstated Dr Fletcher.He said, too, that the drug is \nused legitimately by doctors on a daily basis.\"It is \nused every single day by doctors to induce labour, post-partum \nhaemorrhage (bleeding a lot after delivery) for people who have missed \nabortions, and it is also used for incomplete abortions,\" he explained, \neven as he noted the danger that users face by using the pill without \nmedical supervision.But that has not stopped women \nwho go looking to terminate their pregnancies as the law now allows \nabortions in only special circumstances.In January \n2008, a Ministry of Health-commissioned team recommended that the \ncurrent laws prohibiting abortions be repealed and replaced with \nlegislation outlining conditions under which medical termination of \npregnancy would be lawful.The posture outlined in the\n health ministry report was due in large part to an alarming number of \nbotched abortions taking place on the island.The \nreport, penned by the Abortion Policy Review Advisory Group, revealed \nthat botched abortions were burdening the public-health \nsector.The investigation carried out by the advisory \ngroup at that time revealed that, during a six-month period, hundreds of\n patients suffering from problems as a result of slipshod abortions were\n admitted to a ward at one of the nation's premier public \nhospitals.Additionally, the group pointed out that \nmost of the patients admitted to the ward were \"young, poor, unemployed \nand live in economically and socially deprived \ncommunities\".\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4829, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b89da46653b5ee5a", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:43:39", "title": "Boys caught in the nick of time", "occurred_at": "2012-05-07 04:25:16", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120506/lead/lead3.html", "data": "Anastasia Cunningham, News CoordinatorThey were quite absorbed in their game of cricket.   The relief of being off the streets 'hustling for a food' and away from their normal environment was evident. The safe haven offered by the St Andrew Care Centre for Boys is a refreshing stop for these youths.\"Yow, bowl him out, bowl him out!\" one boy shouted.\"Lick him fi six!\" yelled another.\"Wicket, wicket!\" another screamed.The desolation of their daily situation was a distant memory during that moment in the yard of the Ambrook Lane centre in St Andrew last Thursday, as a light drizzle cooled the afternoon heat.Their game of cricket was all that mattered.For the past 11 years, the St Andrew Parish Church outreach centre has been a sanctuary for these at-risk boys who have found themselves on the streets in need of food, clothing, education, guidance, counselling, love, hope, and a future.Boys as young as six years old who ran away from home, or as old as 20 years with nowhere to go, turn up at the outreach centre.Some were expelled from school and turned to the streets, some refuse to go home for a number of reasons.\"It is very helpful for boys like me and my friend who get kick from school and don't have anywhere to go,\" shared John, one of the 16 boys now enrolled in the programme.\"With here you have no pressure, you get time to do your work,\" stated Mark, an auto mechanic in the making.They have all benefited from the nurturing, rehabilitation and reintegration efforts of the programme the centre offers from 9 a.m.-2 p.m. on weekdays.The aim is to empower them with the essential social, emotional and educational tools to create a better future for themselves.With the assistance of several individuals and organisations like the Possibility Programme, Jamaica Social Investment Fund, Lions Club, Environmental Foundation of Jamaica, UNICEF, American Friends of Jamaica, and Food For The Poor, the centre is able to offer the boys breakfast, lunch, bus fare, clothing, remedial education, counselling and intervention, and psychological needs.Each weekday, the boys stream in for breakfast at 7:30 a.m., before beginning the daily curriculum run by administrative manager Norma Rhoden and the staff of a teacher, social worker, counsellor, and auxiliary workers.Subjects taughtThe academic programme includes mathematics, language arts, reading, general knowledge, science, art and craft, music, barbering, gardening, and physical education. Occasionally, they go on field trips.Leonie Sullivan has been there from the inception. The only teacher at the centre, she has dedicated her life to giving those boys a second chance.Going beyond the call of duty has become the norm for Sullivan, often going off in search of the boys' parents or a boy who has gone missing, or trying to get their birth certificates in order for them to move to the next level of their lives.\"We are not just workers, we have to be teachers, mothers, fathers, referees, nurses, doctors, counsellors, you name it, because they all come to us with one need or another and we have to accommodate those needs,\" Sullivan told The Sunday Gleaner.Over the years, hundreds of boys have passed through the centre, several of them grateful for being given the opportunity to make something of their lives.Sharing their thoughts with The Sunday Gleaner, the boys - aged 12 to 15 years - all have aspirations to make something of their lives, all hoping to do well in the Grade Nine Achievement Test they are preparing to sit on Friday.\"I can recommend anyone to come here. The teachers spend time with us, they teach us ground rules, social graces, how to be better boys and a lot of things we need to learn,\" Kevindeclared, himself looking to go in the field of construction.\"We learn how to work as a team,\" said Tom, an aspiring singer.The care centre also hosts parenting seminars and provides support services for parents and guardians of the children enrolled in the programme.CHALLENGESBut even with the best intentions and purest of hearts, the challenges that the programme poses can be discouraging. Outside of the low literacy and numeracy level of many of the boys, the biggest challenge is their antisocial behaviour.In fact, over the years there has been a high staff turnover, many unwilling to endure the often rude, disrespectful, violent, dishonest, boisterous behaviour of some of the boys.\"It is one thing to deal with the low literacy level and trying to get them to understand just the basics, but when they are very rude and disrespectful, and stealing other people's things, it can really get to you,\" Sullivan said.\"Each year, you have to wonder if this set will be better or worse than the one before.\"Sullivan also finds it problematical having to teach boys of all ages and academic levels together in the sole classroom.\"Some of the boys find it very embarrassing, especially if you have older ones who are unable to read. When they see that the younger ones are reading and they can't, they become embarrassed, angry and frustrated and don't want to participate.\"Sometimes I am forced to do one-on-one sessions. In fact, many of them require a hands-on approach,\" she said.According to Sullivan: \"Children with low literacy levels always have behavioural problems because it is their way of detracting from it, seeking help or to get attention.\"Hoping that each boy will maximise on his potential, the care centre team works hard at getting them to the next level and placed in the formal school system. For the older ones, they are placed in skills-training and employment centres.\"I refuse to give up on one single boy, no matter the challenge,\" she declared.\"Yes, I felt like giving up so many, many times, but I keep getting attached to the boys, and once you form that bond, it is hard to break. But believe me, it is very taxing and you can get easily worn out.\"She continued, \"I keep going because I often wonder, if I leave, will the person replacing me show the same care and concern? Will they put out the same effort and go the extra mile? I know this is my calling, it is my passion.\"SUCCESS STORIESSullivan is heartened by the many boys who were able to turn their lives around because of the work they do at the care centre.Many have gone on to further their studies and pursue careers. Some have returned to express their gratitude.She is disheartened that they have not been able to save all the boys, estimating that they have a 70-per cent success rate.\"I know this is a wonderful, effective, essential programme, despite the challenges. Even though I have seen some that make me wonder, I have seen many, many turn their lives around and made me proud,\" she shared.Names changed to protect their identities.anastasia.cunningham@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4830, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/665a54f92d6bd396", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:43:40", "title": "'Witch-hunt' -

In it he gave a different account from his testimony in court.The policeman said in the case summary that the police and citizens chased the man, caught him and citizens beat him. He said the man was taken to the bushes where the gun and cellular phone were found.A week after he was in custody, Thompson was questioned about the incident and a third account was put to him about the incident.The policeman admitted in re-examination that the case summary was inaccurate, but he said he did not expect that the lawyer would have questioned him about the case summary.The judge described the revelations by the policeman as a deliberate attempt to deceive the court.barbara.gayle@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4832, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bbce8cfd84dbb133", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:43:42", "title": "Learning in filth - Bridgeport Primary subjected to foul smell from nearby canal and sewage treatment plant", "occurred_at": "2012-05-07 04:25:16", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120506/lead/lead6.html", "data": "Ryon Jones, Staff ReporterIt is remarkable how the young minds of Bridgeport Primary in Portmore, St Catherine, are able to function daily, given the stench they have to endure.One of three schools in the community, with Bridgeport Basic School and Bridgeport High being the others, the young charges are subject to the stink from a nearby canal and a National Water Commission (NWC) sewage plant that lies immediately in front of the school.Germaine Road is the only buffer between the 33-year-old school, which has a population of 1,077 students between the ages of six and 12, and the sewage plant, which is one of five similar facilities the NWC has in Portmore.The school's principal, Lorna Lewis, refused to comment on the issue, citing directives from the Ministry of Education.Last year, the Lewis-led school achieved a 60 per cent mastery in the Grade Four Literacy Test, with 33 per cent of the students achieving near mastery and only seven per cent non-mastery.But despite this strong performance in testing conditions, Lewis refused to speak, telling our news team that the ministry prohibits school administrators from speaking to the media on certain matters.But that did not stop persons close to the school from speaking.'I blame the Government'\"I blame the Government, because the sewer and the canal were there all along and the Government still put the school here,\" one person with close ties to the school said.\"They should have realised that the stench would have affected the school,\" added the official who asked that her name be withheld.A Bridgeport resident, Carol Masson, who has lived in the area for five years and has a pair of twin girls attending the school, was livid.\"The cesspool is very stink. I think it should be removed, because you have the kids inhaling all those bad odours and having their lunch with the smell around,\" argued Masson.\"I think they built the school at the wrong place, because the mosquitoes and the odour attack the students daily,\" added Masson.The Sunday Gleaner team struggled to breathe during the visit to the school last week. The stench was unbearable, even when the team retreated to the vehicle and closed all the windows.\"They have to do something about this condition or, sooner or later, an epidemic is going to break out, especially among the kids,\" said Carol Osborn, who has lived in the community for more than 30 years.\"We have a citizens' association, but everything seems to have fallen on deaf ears. Everything runs on a political basis, but this is human beings we are dealing with. This is a health hazard and if they don't do anything, a lot of people going to die off, especially the kids,\" he added.NWC's corporate public relations manager, Charles Buchanan, conceded that the company has a problem with the Bridgeport sewage plant.He said the plant is unable to manage the volume of waste that is flowing into it. But Buchanan stated that plans are in place to remedy the situation.\"The Bridgeport sewage-treatment plant is old and is overloaded. The volume of discharge, legally and otherwise, coming to the plant is more than the plant can properly handle,\" Buchanan disclosed.\"We have a programme under the Kingston sewage development programme and, in particular, the Portmore component, where we are proposing that the Bridgeport sewage plant, as well as the four others in Portmore, be upgraded and converted into sewage-pumping stations.\"That would take the sewage generated in those homes and businesses in Portmore to the Soapberry sewage-treatment plant elsewhere in the parish, which is a new facility and has a greater capacity,\" he added.Additional concernsWhile that is good news for the residents, Simeon Vernon, whose seven-year-old son attends the school, identified some additional concerns he has relating to the safety of the children.\"It don't seem as if the authorities understand the cries of us as the citizens of the area, because the other day when the councillors were walking around, we asked them if they can chop out the bushes that are beside the school, because you have girls over there and there are perverts around, and nothing has been done,\" declared Vernon.\"There are also crocodiles in the canal and there is a school right beside it.\"If you come in the evenings between 4:30 and 5:30, there are a lot of john crows behind the school, beside the canal bank, and when it is break time, you see the kids running up and down there.

This was fashioned from the British system. But in 1980, with the political violence of the period, supervised home-birth service was discontinued,\" said Nash.Three decades later, crime remains a factor, and the nurses have again made adjustments to the programme.\"We have had to ask some clients to come to us. Crime and violence have caused us to take that action, plus some areas are really inaccessible to our service,\" said Nash.Difficulty getting to patientsShe was supported by registered midwife Olubunmi Asunmo, who said getting to some patients is often very difficult.\"Sometimes you have to park far and cross gullies on a piece of plank. Then you have to go into some narrow alleys to find the mothers. On top of that, you may have to deal with dogs,\" said Asunmo.This was endorsed by nearly all the eight registered midwives who were waiting to begin their daily service when The Sunday Gleaner visited the hospital last week.Chief midwife, Sister Sheila Bonnick, said the midwives have rescued several mothers and new-borns facing serious illnesses after their discharge from the hospital.\"The most common problem we find among post-natal mothers is high blood pressure. Then fever, jaundice among the newborns, and dehydration when the mothers don't know how to properly breastfeed,\" said Sister Bonnick.Other common problems include: \"Diaper rash on the babies as the mothers don't change them until the diapers are soaking. Sometimes there is post-partum depression with the mothers and hygiene issues, where they don't take care of themselves and the babies,\" said another midwife.She recalled how the intervention of a domiciliary team, several years ago, saved the life of a young child who they realised was gravely ill.\"We bustled the child out of the house and went straight to the hospital,\" she said.Demand is sometimes very high, and Sister Bonnick said in spite of the challenges, the service is providing vital assistance.\"It would be very sad if the service was no longer available,\" she stated.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4834, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/147f6c549a9cb703", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:43:44", "title": "Media challenges - Internet use in Jamaica troubling", "occurred_at": "2012-05-07 04:25:16", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120506/lead/lead8.html", "data": "To mark World Press Freedom Day, the Press Association of Jamaica (PAJ), the Media Association of Jamaica and UNESCO Caribbean launched the PAJ's Hall of Fame and hosted a forum under the theme, 'New Voices: Media Freedom Helping to Transform Societies'. Veteran broadcast journalist and managing director of Nationwide News Network, Cliff Hughes, was among the presenters. This is an edited version of his presentation.In the past year, we all have been encouraged by the unprecedented global socio-political democratic developments in which various media played an important role.Indeed, many factors came into play with the events taking place particularly in the Arab states, including underlying economic woes and political suppression.This elicited mass organisation, especially by the younger generations.However, we cannot deny the fact that the freedom to harness the power of information and communication technologies, and especially those of new media, played a significant role.This has reaffirmed what the World Press Freedom Day had been defending for the past 20 years. Media freedom is part of the package of fundamental rights for which people will strive.The World Press Freedom Day was jointly established in 1991 by UNESCO and the United Nations Department of Public Information, which emphasises the idea that press freedom should be understood as necessitating pluralism and independence for the mass media at large.The confluence of press freedom and freedom of expression, through various traditional and new media, has given rise to an unprecedented level of media freedom.It is helping to enable civil society, young people and communities to bring about massive social and political transformations.Media freedom entails the right of any person to freedom of opinion and expression on a public basis.Critically, this includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media, regardless of boundaries (Article 19 - Universal Declaration of Human Rights).Power of mediaRecent uprisings in Arab states have highlighted the power of media and the human quest for media freedom, as well as underlining the fact that social inequality will indefinitely search for equilibrium.Could the Arab Spring have taken place without the proliferation of social media or satellite television?Information and communication technologies like text messaging and social media have enabled the diffusion of vital information to reach the widest number of people in a very short span of time.Social media have enabled protesters to self-organise and attract young people in the fight to be able to freely express themselves and the aspirations of their wider communities.Here in Jamaica, what are we seeing? Thirty-eight per cent of Jamaicans use the Internet at least once each day.This, according to an islandwide survey conducted by Professor Hopeton Dunn of the Mona School of Business' Telecommunications Policy Management Programme between November 2010 and January 2011.The study surveyed 2,200 Jamaican households and individuals. Almost 16 per cent of the respondents had access to the Internet at home.This is not to be confused with the finding that only 24 per cent of the Jamaican population has access to a computer at home.However, the troubling story behind Dunn's findings lies not only in the relatively low levels of Internet penetration, but in the pattern of use of arguably the greatest invention for centuries.The most popular uses of the Internet were for sending and receiving email, which 77 per cent reported doing in the past 12 months.Use on social networks was the second most popular activity, with 72 per cent of respondents reporting using websites such as Facebook and Twitter.Educational use was third with 65 per cent.The study showed that the majority of Jamaican Internet users are between 15 and 34 years old. Among households, 53 per cent were shown to have access to fixed broadband, while 34 per cent have access to mobile broadband. Seventy five per cent of mobile phone users said they are aware of mobile Internet but have never used it. Fourteen per cent of those who access the Internet do so via their mobile phones.The troubling aspect is how few Jamaicans are using the Internet to transact business and increase productivity and efficiencies. Indeed, the Global Information Technology Report of 2010-2011 noted a decline in Internet penetration and usage for productive enterprise in Jamaica.It ranked Jamaica 73 in the world. That ranking places us among the top 10 worst countries as it relates to access and use of the Internet for business transactions.This reality should challenge us as a country and media fraternity to increase awareness of the enormous business opportunities there are on the Internet.This is a low-hanging fruit that we should quickly exploit to help turn around our struggling households.We have a young and receptive population who should be encouraged to look to the Internet to create jobs and exploit income-generating opportunities.If we could utilise the plethora of new media platforms and distribution channels to empower our vast army of young people to become independent income earners, that would be transformational. It is not beyond us.Globally, as of April 2012, Facebook had more than 900 million active users, 600,000 of whom are Jamaicans living in Jamaica. In the wider Caribbean, there are 6.3 million 'Facebookers'.Smartphones are also radically changing how we communicate and socialise.Promising to transform societies This new-found media freedom is promising to transform societies in ways perhaps unimaginable only a couple of years ago.It has enabled the emergence of new ways to communicate, to share information and knowledge, market to global audiences goods and services, and for people to widen their sense of participation, identity and belonging.It has brought down borders. It has made redundant brick and mortar and reduced the need for huge capital outlay to get started in business.And a social upside, it has freed up many of us to work from home and better balance the demands of parenting and earning a buck.Media freedom, including online freedom, also plays a dynamic role in the economic transformation of society.Indeed, it is an incentive for foreign companies and private investments. Companies are much more disposed to have long-term business interest in countries where media freedom is respected. It is necessary to ensure the transparency of public information so as to curb corruption.Yet, media freedom is fragile, and it is also not yet within the reach of everyone. While the enabling environment for true media freedom is improving, the harsh reality is that many in the world still do not have access to basic communication technology.Furthermore, as more reporting is transmitted online, more and more online journalists are being harassed for their work. For this, UNESCO has dedicated a web page, UNESCO Remembers Assassinated Journalists, to remember those who have perished in their efforts.I note that the Broadcasting Commission is signalling that it wants legislation to give it the power to regulate the Internet in Jamaica. I urge caution.We, as a fraternity, must be very wary and vigilant about the objectives here and the instinct by some to overreach.Years of suppression, censorship and restriction have now been replaced by the convergence of social media, mobile connections and satellite TV. Media freedom has amplified and multiplied each individual voice.As media freedom grows, the strength of the new voices grows, and their calls for social transformation and positive political change have become an unstoppable force. The content of this speech draws heavily on the Concept Paper produced by UNESCO to mark World Press Freedom Day 2012. The contents of the entire concept paper can be found on the website of UNESCO.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4835, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/064f3ef7b4672304", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:43:44", "title": "Johnson returned as mayor of London ...

The result was announced just minutes before midnight - more than 24 hours after polls had closed.Johnson's victory could be bittersweet for Cameron - offering relief from his party's national woes, but cementing the outspoken city chief as a likely future leadership rival.Cameron's Conservatives took a bruising in votes in the 181 local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland which held polls this year, losing more than 400 seats - including some in the leader's own political district.Although the results won't put Cameron's leadership in jeopardy, they prompted grass-roots Conserva-tives to urge him to ditch some of his more liberal policies, including the planned introduction of same-sex marriage.LEGISLATIVE HOPES DASHEDJohnson, who has appealed to traditionalists with messages on tax cuts and looser ties to Europe, is increasingly seen as a plausible national leader - not least for bucking his party's national slump.\"The best thing for Cameron would be to have Boris locked into the London mayoralty for the next four years and out of the way,\" said Patrick Dunleavy, a political science professor at the London School of Economics.Cameron also suffered a blow to his legislative hopes, as nine cities - including Manchester, Birmingham and Newscastle-upon-Tyne - voted down plans to have their own directly elected city mayors.Like Cameron, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats - the junior partner in Britain's coalition government - suffered a collapse, losing 336 councillors. That pushed their total number of local councillors below 3,000 for the first time since the party formed in 1988.Main opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband toasted his own party's revival after its ousting from national office in the 2010 national election. It won control of 32 more local authorities and claimed 823 new council seats.\"We are a party winning back people's trust,\" Miliband said. \"People are hurting. People are suffering from this recession, people are suffering from a government that raises taxes for them and cuts taxes for millionaires.\"Cameron insisted his poll battering was to be expected at the midpoint before a 2015 national election, and with his government carrying out gruelling economic repairs following the global economic crisis.\"These are difficult times and there aren't easy answers,\" Cameron acknowledged.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4836, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53cb2ec0e3524eac", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:43:45", "title": "Stars to shine - JN Jamaica Invitational attracts top athletes to island", "occurred_at": "2012-05-07 04:25:16", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120506/lead/lead1.html", "data": "Tyrone Reid, Senior Staff ReporterA yearlong moratorium on a $28-million National Housing Trust (NHT) loan to the agency's managing director is raising eyebrows in several quarters.The company's policy clearly states that staff members are only entitled to a two-month moratorium on loans from the organisation, and that the amount of the loan should not exceed 2.5 times the staff member's annual salary.Responding to Sunday Gleaner queries, NHT Managing Director A. Cecile Watson said she would refer what she described as an \"anomaly\" to the recently appointed board for its consideration.The Sunday Gleaner understands that the loan was approved in 2011. The new board took up office only a week ago.Ammended loanWatson explained that in 2010, the NHT amended its construction loan policy to enable its customers to have a period of up to 12 months before they begin repayment.\"A segment of my loan relates to construction/home improvement and I sought approval for a similar arrangement, and this was approved by the (then) chairman,\" said Watson.\"At the time of take-up of my loan, it came to my attention that the staff loan arrangement related to construction had not as yet been amended to be in keeping with the revised policy to our contributors,\" she added in a written response.Efforts to reach the former chairman were futile. However, yesterday the new NHT chairman, Easton Douglas, told The Sunday Gleaner that he did not know why Watson referred to it as an anomaly.Douglas did not provide any documentation to show the grounds on which the moratorium was granted to Watson.He said it was his opinion that the stay of payment being enjoyed by the managing director is covered under the 2010 amendment because it was his view that it applied to all contributors and beneficiaries.However, later in the interview, Douglas read from a memo penned by Watson on May 3, 2012 to the board of directors captioned 'Twelve-month moratorium for repayment of construction loan/home improvement loan facility: staff mortgage'.In the memo, Watson was asking the board to extend the moratorium on staff loan home improvement/construction loans from two months to 12 months.Meanwhile, Watson did not deny or confirm the amount she borrowed from the trust, but said the mortgage was above board.\"A mortgage loan accorded to me by the NHT is in keeping with my contract terms, and the amount is in keeping with the policy that relates to other staff members,\" she said.

They have completely refurbished the office building, two gazebos in the lower section, and are about to install tree labels and direction signs.Looking for helpFor Ramdon the intervention is much appreciated but he opines that more needs to be done to keep the facility well kept and attractive to visitors as it is open to the public every day, including public holidays.He told The Gleaner: \"We are still looking for help because right now there are about six entry points and two that are without gates, and it's a challenge because the garden's opening hours are fixed, but even when the garden is closed, we can still see people walking in and out.\"In the past, funding agencies have rejected funding requests, insisting that management must first show how it plans to maintain the grounds and its facilities after rehabilitation. Entry to the gardens has been free since it opened in November 1962, but today's harsh financial realities could result in an entrance fee being charged.Random explained: \"The thinking is that Government cannot provide these facilities for free and we have to try to earn our keep. So for groups, we should charge some amount of fee, particularly those who are coming to have picnics where they occupy a space, a gazebo, or so. However, for the regular persons who are coming as a family, it would essentially still be free for the time being.

My passion to share with the needy came about through fervent prayer, asking God to see how best I might be able to assist the less fortunate and the destitute. I love what I am doing, and my wife is a true inspiration. Ever since donating a tidy sum to the rehabilitation shelter, I have been attached to that facility and its residents. I have met some amazing people there, who, because of poverty, low self-esteem, lack of confidence, and without family, are unable to function independently.\"According to Florea, between the rehabilitation facility and the football teams, he has been able to positively affect the lives of all the parties, which has given him a sense of accomplishment, fullness, and peace, as his love for the common people is displayed daily.Motivating factorFlorea added that although every community has its share of violent practices, the people in Portland are probably the most friendly he has encountered over the last 23 years. He added that the thought of touching people's lives was a motivating factor for him.Florea's work thus far has not gone unnoticed as Dale Westin, general manager of the Errol Flynn Marina, has indicated that the work undertaken by Florea should be made public. According to Westin, Florea has transformed the rehabilitation facility in such a way that the residents there hold him in high regard.One of the residents, who has been at the facility for more than three years, Richard Morris, said a number of measures put in place by Florea have been bearing fruit and have motivated residents at the facility to get more involved in supporting the new initiatives.\"Him teach us to plant our own garden. And so we now have our own fruits and vegetable growing. We are now raising our own chicken for food, and we are happy with what he is doing here for us.\"In addition, Florea is managing the Eagle Strickers football team, which is contesting the Sper League, along with another community-based team at Drapers.

The portfolio minister has no role in the setting of interim rates.\"Here it is that a minister is trying to divest himself of the authority, which in itself is a good thing. But where is the power being divested to? The OUR, an organisation which, with the greatest of respect, there is not a customer of the JPS or the Water Commission who would speak in kind terms of the way in which the OUR has proceeded,\" Tavares-Finson added.Significant impactThe opposition senator said granting the OUR the power to set rates could have a significant impact on the telecoms industry and the country's fiscal accounts.But Tavares-Finson's opposition colleague Kamina Johnson-Smith disagreed with him. She noted that the amended legislation has significantly enhanced the regulator's powers.\"Growth cannot effectively be fostered in the telecoms industry without a strong and independent regulator, otherwise paralysis can be brought about by pressure from (strong) players, by strategies of delay, by failure to provide information and by general manipulation,\" Johnson-Smith said.She, however, noted that the concerns expressed by Tavares-Finson are understandable and argued that it is important to strike a balance between facilitating market forces while ensuring proper regulation of the marketplace.In the meantime, Justice Minister Mark Golding said the OUR would be encouraged to do more to build public confidence.The Senate passed the bill without amendment. It will now be sent to the governor general for his assent. Golding has called the bill a pioneering and watershed piece of legislation.Already, the minister with responsibility for telecommunications, Phillip Paulwell, said it will lead to a significant reduction in call rates to consumers.\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4851, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a517c738c88bcfda", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:43:58", "title": "Jamaican youth to show off technology skills in mobile apps contest", "occurred_at": "2012-05-05 03:45:16", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120504/lead/lead9.html", "data": "Alessandro Boyd, Gleaner WriterTHE GOVERNMENT of Jamaica and the World Bank have sponsored a mobile application contest to encourage and inspire youth to develop their information technology skills.A five-day Digital Jam 2.0 Mobile Applications Development workshop, which got under way on Monday, has been designed to assist youth to develop their skills. The workshop is being held at the University of the West Indies, Mona campus, St Andrew.Foundation skills and great potential \"These skills and directions will provide what they need to know to make it easy for people to leverage their existing skills that they have in website making. They can take simple games and turn them into a mobile application,\" said main presenter at the workshop, John Henry Thompson, internationally renowned Jamaican computer scientist and inventor of the Lingo script language.Contestants are required to build effective native mobile applications for devices such as the iPhone, the Android, and the BlackBerry.A maximum of four persons per team are allowed to compete, however, only one concept can be submitted per team. At least half the members of each team must be of Jamaican citizenship or parentage and under the age of 25 years old. There are several categories. Entrants can centre what they do around applications such as geotagging and social utilities.\"I have a passion for making technology accessible to folks and cherish the opportunity to give back to my homeland. That is why I'm here. This is one event leading up to the contest that ends in June.\" Thompson said on Monday.Creativity meets technologyHe added: \"We're focusing on the foundational attributes and getting people to make a collaborative effort between someone with a strong artistic, interactive design capability and somebody with programming skills.\"Thompson said technology was constantly evolving, and that a few years ago, people did not have mobile devices.

Matalon, president of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica, told The Gleaner yesterday.Members of the Dr Peter Phillips-chaired committee yesterday reviewed a draft report which is to be sent to the House of Representatives.The draft report states that the committee firmly believes an efficient transfer mechanism must be put in place to address the needs of vulnerable income groups.The draft report outlines a list of items that should be exempt from GCT. The items are milk, canned sardines, cooking oil, infant formula, brown sugar, flour, rice, insecticides for farming, chicken, fertiliser, prescription drugs, orthopaedic appliances, sanitary towels and tampons, artificial breathing apparatus and solar water heaters.Economist Joseph Cox said the position of the committee, as contained in the draft report, represents \"a victory for the poor\".Tax could increase miseryCox had vehemently opposed the proposal of the Private Sector Working Group (PSWG) which, in its submission to the committee, recommended the removal of GCT exemption on items such as basic foods.\"The support mechanism that had been advocated was woefully inadequate, and if the Government had gone ahead and placed the GCT on some of those items that have been mentioned, the simple fact of life is that it would have increased the misery on the most vulnerable,\" Cox said.The group has suggested the elimination of GCT exemption on items and a lowering of the GCT rate from 17.5 to 12.5 per cent. It also recommended that additional resources be put into the Programme of Advancement Through Health and Education to assist the most vulnerable.Yesterday, Matalon said he could not comment on behalf of the PSWG, which he also represents, until he has had discussions with the rest of the membership.In the meantime, the Phillips committee has recommended that, like other patties, beef patty be subject to GCT.It also recommended that electricity, oil products and imports, telephone services, as well as agricultural inputs, be given differential treatment. The report, however, does not indicate what this treatment would mean for consumers of those products.The committee is to propose special treatment for schoolbooks.\"We had taken the decision that (if) the exemption for printed materials would be removed, that we wanted to preserve one, specifically for books used in the schools,\" Phillips said as committee members perused the draft report yesterday.No expected consequencesIn the meantime, Phillips has signalled that there is unlikely to be any consequences for Jamaica if Parliament accepts the report and tax measures are applied in line with the expressions of Parliament.Committee member Karl Samuda had questioned the possible impact on Jamaica as a result of the committee taking a position that runs counter to that held by the Inter-American Development Bank.\"No, this report can't compromise any position of anybody else. This report is a report of the appropriate committee of the Parliament in Jamaica,\" Phillips said.Jamaica is currently in discussions with the International Monetary Fund, critical to which is the matter of tax reform.\"There is no friction that has been made apparent to me on any of these matters,\" Phillips said.The finance minister, however, stressed that it was important that the committee complete its work quickly.\"The Parliament needs to understand that there is a whole host of not only domestic, but, I dare say, international expectations hinged on this report,\" Phillips said.\"We cannot afford either to get it wrong or to get it delayed.\"If the report is accepted by the House of Representatives, Cabinet will prepared a White Paper outlining the Government's policy direction on taxation. Phillips will also have to go to Parliament with a tax package.daraine.luton@gleanerjm.com&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}, {"pk": 4854, "model": "listener.rawdata", "fields": {"data_id": "tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a4798fd875aedecc", "created_at": "2012-05-11 20:44:01", "title": "Court rules in favour of INDECOM", "occurred_at": "2012-05-05 03:45:16", "source": 4, "link": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120503/lead/lead2.html", "data": "Barbara Gayle, Staff ReporterThe Independent Commission of Investigations (INDECOM) is celebrating what it describes as \"a major victory\" as the Constitutional Court threw out a motion brought by eight policemen who were seeking declarations that the commission did not have the power to compel them to give statements. Attorneys-at-law Richard Small and Shawn Steadman had argued that if the court ruled in favour of the policemen, it would be impossible for INDECOM to investigate any allegation of murder or wrongful police conduct.Supreme Court judges Carol Beswick, Bryan Sykes and Frank Williams ruled yesterday that the Terrence Williams-led INDECOM acted within the scope of the law when it called for the policemen to furnish statements in relation to the fatal shootings of Derrick Bolton and Rohan Dixon in Tredegar Park, St Catherine, in August 2010. The judges ruled that the policemen's claim should not be considered by the Constitutional Court because there were alternative remedies available which ought to be used.Compliance with standardsThe court said the rationale for Parliament's enactment of the INDECOM Act was to make Jamaica compliant with international human-rights standards, which place a procedural obligation on Jamaica to effectively and promptly investigate the taking of life by members of the security forces or other agents of the state.In handing down the unanimous decision, the court recommended that the law should be changed to specifically state that any information garnered by INDECOM would not be used in criminal proceedings. The court said the law should also be amended for INDECOM to inform people being investigated of their right to judicial review.INDECOM's application for legal costs was refused.The policemen were charged last year after they refused to provide statements to INDECOM regarding the killing of the two men in Tredegar Park. The case is pending in the Corporate Area Resident Magistrate's Court.Attorneys-at-law Carolyn Reid-Cameron and Chukwuemeka Cameron had argued that INDECOM had no power under the Constitution to force the policemen to give statements.INDECOM had served notices on the policemen, identifying them as suspects, and ordered them to attend the Video Identification Unit at the Central Police Station on September 14, 2010 to furnish statements and answer questions.The policemen said they were seeking to protect their constitutional rights to a fair trial or fair hearing, seeking constitutional protection against self-incrimination, the right of silence, and the protection of the presumption of innocence.barbara.gayle@gleanerjm.com\n&#13;\n      &#13;\n      ", "tags": [3]}}]
